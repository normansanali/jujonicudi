Edwin has released 12 albums so far, the most successful being “Misguided Roses” (1997). McCain has been active in the entertainment industry since 1991.</p><p>How much is the net worth of Edwin McCain? It has been estimated by authoritative sources that the outright size of his wealth is as much as $7 million, as of the data given in the late 2016. Music is the main source of McCain’s fortune and popularity.</p><h3>Edwin McCain Net Worth $7 Million</h3><p>To begin with, he was adopted in his infancy. Later, Edwin was educated at Christ Church Episcopal School in Greenville, South Carolina, then entered Coastal Carolina University and College of Charleston, yet dropped out without graduating.</p><p>Concerning his professional career, his first release was the independent album entitled “Nomadic Logic” (1991), and a couple of years later he published another independent album “Solitude” (1993), however, neither of them attracted much attention. In 1995, he signed a contract for four albums with Atlantic Records, and the label released his debut studio album “Honor Among Thieves” (1995) which appeared in 107th position on the Billboard Top 200 chart. In 1997, the second album “Misguided Roses” was released which managed to reach 73rd position of the aforementioned chart, however, the lead single “I’ll Be” from this album reached the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100. After two more albums – “Messenger” (1999) and “Far from Over” (2001) -Atlantic and McCain split up due to musical differences: the company expected him to write pop ballads, but this did not correspond to the musical ideas of Edwin. Then, McCain signed to ATC and published an album containing acoustic versions of his songs – “Austin Sessions” (2003). Following this, he again changed labels and released the album “Scream & Whisper” (2004) which managed to enter Billboard Top 200. His last three albums did not enter the charts – “Lost in America” (2006) released by Vanguard Records, “Nobody’s Fault But Mine” (2008) by Saguaro Road Records and “Mercy Bound” (2011) by 429 Records. There were rumours flying that a new studio album will be released soon, although McCain has not confirm this fact.</p><p>It should be said that McCain performs in many concerts, often numbering more than 300 a year. He is usually accompanied by a solid band, consisting of guitarists Larry Chaney and Pete Riley, the saxophonist and keyboardist Craig Shields, the bassist Jason Pomar and drummer Tez Sherrard. To conclude, all the aforementioned engagements have added significant sums to the total size of Edwin McCain’s net worth.</p><p>Finally, in the personal life of the singer, Edwin McCain has been married to Christy since 1999, and the family has two biological sons as well as an adopted child.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=30.049167927383><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Edwin McCain</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$7 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>January 20, 1970</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Greenville, South Carolina, USA</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Profession</td><td>Singer-songwriter, Musician</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Education</td><td>Christ Church Episcopal School in Greenville, South Carolina, College of Charleston, Coastal Carolina University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Christy</td></tr><tr readability=16><td>Parents</td><td>Wendy McCain, Watt McCain Jr., I'll Be, I Could Not Ask for More, Walk With You, Durham, NC, United States, Asheville, NC, United States, Rocky Mount, VA, United States</td></tr><tr readability=0.34042553191489><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/theedwinmccain</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.34146341463415><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/theedwinmccain</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.36842105263158><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://myspace.com/edwinmccain</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1272512</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.28070175438596><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.allmusic.com/artist/edwin-mccain-mn0000174198</a></td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Record Labels</td><td>Lava, Vanguard, 429 Records, Saguaro Road Records</td></tr><tr readability=16><td>Albums</td><td>“Misguided Roses” (1997), "Nomadic Logic" (1991), "Honor Among Thieves" (1995), “Messenger” (1999), “Far from Over” (2001), "Tinsel and Tap Shoes" (2004, DVD), "Far from Over" (2001), "Lost in America" (2006), "Nobody's Fault But Mine" (2008), "The Best of Edwin McCain" (2010, compilations)</td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>Edwin McCain Band</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>TV Shows</td><td>"Higher Ground" (2000), "A Cinderella Story" (2004), "Inside Music With Edwin McCain" (Sirius radio network, 2003), "USS John C.
