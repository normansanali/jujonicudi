Answer
Spinach dip may be served with a variety of crackers, however it is especially well-suited to crackers with a firm crunch, such as Triscuits and Wheat Thins, which are both available at most grocery stores. Spinach combines nicely with cheeses such as feta and Parmesan, so consider serving your dip with crackers that have a cheese taste to them to give another flavour depth to your dish.
