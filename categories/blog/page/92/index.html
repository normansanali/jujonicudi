STANDARD, Ill. — A 3.6-magnitude earthquake shook north-central Illinois early Wednesday morning. The quake, which the USGS recorded at 4:41 a.m., was at a depth of 2.8 miles just south of the Illinois River.
The USGS lists that area as a stable continental region, and earthquakes are unusual here. It may have been the result of faulting bedrock.
The earthquake was fairly large, at 3.6 on the Richter scale. Because of its location, it would have been felt for around 60 miles from the epicenter.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Pepe Garza Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</h2><time>Aug 18, 2024</time>
