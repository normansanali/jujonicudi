Javiera is the oldest Pascal sibling, and Pedro is the second eldest in the Pascal crew (his birthday is April 2, 1975). Pedro and Javiera were born in Santiago, Chile.</p><p>Lux and Nicolás are Pedro's younger siblings. Career-wise, Nicolás chose a more under-the-radar job than his superstar brother. He is a pediatric neurologist.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pedro Pascal accompanied his sister, Javiera Balmaceda, to the 2023 Oscars.</h2><p>As it turns out, Pedro's sister Javiera is also in the entertainment biz!

Lux is an actor herself, and a transgender activist (you can follow her on Instagram @<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">luxpascal_</a>).</p><p>Lux actually got her MFA in acting from Julliard School sometime in 2023. In addition to starring in several Chilean films, Lux also had on role in <a href=#>Narcos</a> back in 2017, so she and Pedro were once co-stars!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pedro and his siblings grew up in California and Texas.</h2><p>Pedro's mother and father were forced to flee Chile back in the 1970s due to political unrest, so Pedro and his siblings were raised in Orange County, Calif. and San Antonio, Tex. However, the Pascal siblings were eventually able to take trips back to Chile with their parents once it was safe enough to do so, so they could visit their relatives there.</p><p>The The Last of Us star has never forgotten where he came from.</p><p>Pedro said in his Saturday Night Live monologue that, "[My parents] were so brave, and without them, I wouldn’t be here in this wonderful country,” Pascal said, starting to choke up. “And I certainly wouldn’t be standing here with you all tonight. So, to all my family watching in Chile, I just want to say, te amo, te extraño and deja de dar mi informacíon personal, which means, I love you, I miss you, and stop giving out my phone number.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpbKlvs5mp5qrk5a5br%2FIm6Oippeo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-the-christian-perspective-on-goth-emo.html><span>←</span><span>What is the Christian perspective on Goth / Emo?</span></a>
