The "Pound Town" performer took to social media recently to reveal that she was <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">turned away</a> from a high school in her hometown of St. Louis. According to her, she was planning to speak to some lucky students but wasn't allowed in because she smelled like weed.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Yesterday (April 3), Sexyy Red was active on her Instagram Story, sharing fun clips of herself outside of the school. Sadly, the fun ended there, as she later ranted about being denied entry. "So look so this school I came up here, got cute. Tried to talk to the kids give em the word of the day... And they gonna put me off tell me I smell like weed," she says in a clip. "B*tch you're nobody, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">they ain't come to see you Otis!</a> B*tch, you heard who they're screaming for."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-sexyy-red-got-cute-for-nothing>Sexyy Red "Got Cute" For Nothing</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Luckily, there were plenty of college-aged fans willing to give her a warm welcome. Shortly after being turned away from the high school, she cruised around the entrance of Harris Stowe State University. This isn't the first time Sexyy Red's antics proved to be too much for her teenage audience, however. Over the summer, a clip of the "SkeeYee" rapper entering a high school gymnasium, and being met by <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">countless screaming students</a>, sparked uproar. Social media users agreed that her music is far too raunchy for kids, and slammed the MC for the visit.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">According to her, however, she was simply there to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">donate to the students' prom</a> and didn't actually perform.
