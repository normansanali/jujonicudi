Born in 1974, she walked down the aisle with her beloved husband Scott Myles on March 21, 1997. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Distractify</a>, Scott is a graphic designer by profession. As of now, it has been 25 years of Kim and Scott's togetherness. However, Kim is not seen posting much about her personal life on social media. The last time she penned down the sweet note for her husband was at their 21st anniversary. Kim uploaded a selfie of her and Scott, captioning the post, "Celebrating the 21st anniversary of our first date here in NYC! My (heart emoji) still burns for this man @scott.r.myles, and the bar where it all began."&nbsp;</p><p>Scott's account from Instagram has been deleted. He is not even on any other social media platforms. Therefore, very less is known about Kim's husband. From what we have learned, Kim and Scott started a business ice cream parlor in New York City. They named the shop '5 Boroughs Ice Cream'. Well, one of the flavors, named 'Staten Island Landfill' got them in controversy. This later led them to close their business just 2 years after the opening. The couple further moved to Los Angeles as Kim got successful in designing industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Kim has shared a snap of her wedding day on social media. The 48-year-old captioned the D-day photo, "Wedding day shenanigans in Gramercy Park." Kim and Scott are seen holding hands while they run along with their friends on the street. There is not much information about their children. However, Kim has one friend on her list named Nicole Myles. Nicole may be her daughter as they have the same surname. But, she could also be her sister-in-law. The couple does have a dog named Maizy.&nbsp;</p><p>'Battle of the Bling' will feature 15 lavish houses. The judges on the panel will be Keith Bynum, Jackie Seigel, Alison Victoria, along with Hall and Kim. Every week, judges will select 3 houses, based on the wow factor, originality, and execution of the transformation.</p><p>'Battle of the Bling' will premiere on December 9, 2022, at 9 pm ET on HGTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjKSgpmWdrrmmv4yhrKyakaOxbrnEnqtmoJepw26uwK2rpZ1dpLNuwMeeZJukmaO0brTOrKusZZenrrG0yJxknZ2jnrSvsdFmn66rkpa7pQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-jon-tenney-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Jon Tenney Dating Now</span></a>
