His reasoning behind this difficult choice was revealed in full in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this video</a>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=544 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true>In some of the most heartbreaking writing we’ve ever read, Dream captioned the above video, “thank you all from the bottom of my heart to those that supported me, even though I am ugly. I appreciate you all more than you could ever know, and I will be working on my face while I’m masked again.” Dream had revealed his face for the first time on Oct. 2, 2022, after six years of staying hidden in his videos. He is working on taking down every image of his face online, hoping to become a faceless content creator again.</p><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false>Before the unmasking incident, Dream was accumulating 100,000,000 views per video, so that gives us a good screenshot for roughly how much his net worth might be. For a period of time, Dream had one of the fastest-growing YouTube channels ever, and sources say his net worth sits at around <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$2 million</a>, but this has supposedly decreased from around the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$6-10 million</a> range.</p><p data-characters=169 data-current-count=541 data-injectable=true>Although his channel has been around since 2014, Dream didn’t initially gain recognition until 2019 with the release of his “Minecraft Manhunt” series.</p><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=241 data-injectable=false>An American, Clay lives in&nbsp;Orlando, Florida, with fellow internet personalities&nbsp;GeorgeNotFound&nbsp;and Sapnap. He has been vocal about his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ADHD diagnosis</a> and his anonymous avatar was inspired by an image a former girlfriend posted <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on Discord</a>.</p><p data-characters=149 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>Right now, Dream continues to rebuild his public image and attempts to revive the Dream personality despite the negative reaction to his face reveal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZ2eu6av0ZqdrWWppMK1wcGeqWacopqurr%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-does-with-this-ring-i-thee-wed-mean-html.html><span>←</span><span>What does with this ring I thee wed mean?</span></a>
