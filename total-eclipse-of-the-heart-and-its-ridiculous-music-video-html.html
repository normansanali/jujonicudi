In case you’ve forgotten: This video is glorious in its ridiculousness. To emphasize just how ridiculously glorious, I have written this review of the key elements in the clip, which was <a href=#>directed by Russell Mulcahy</a>, a man I will forever revere because, during the same era, he was responsible for putting a shirtless John Taylor from Duran Duran <a href=#>on a Sri Lankan elephant</a>. Enjoy, and please don’t stare directly at this video for too long or you will go partially blind.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj6mfcrko00093k5tkgj9aqdz@published data-word-count=117><strong>Opening sequence:</strong> The video begins by closing in on a window at what is either a megamansion or the ’80s version of Hogwarts. Inside that room are Bonnie Tyler and a bunch of stuff that was apparently stolen from Stevie Nicks’s dressing room: fans, a gauzy bandanna, and a ton of candles. A dove — or perhaps Stevie Nicks’s white cockatoo from <a href=#>the Bella Donna album cover</a> — flies in through an open doorway and flaps its wings in place, oblivious to the fact that the song is telling it to turn around. A shadow moves across a full moon. Tyler looks plaintively out the window from underneath seven tons of eye shadow. This video is meaningful.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj6mfcrjm00073k5tzawl3vv7@published data-word-count=44><strong>Enter the weird schoolboy.</strong> I told you this was ’80s Hogwarts! Except this kid is definitely not a Hufflepuff. He has scary, glowing blue eyes because Mulcahy and his team were like, “Let’s take the part where she sings about bright eyes extremely literally.”</p><figure data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/giphy/instances/cj6mfycwh00003k5tpdbum9it@published class=giphy data-editable=url></figure><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj6mfcrr8000c3k5tee1x1n2s@published data-word-count=22><strong>Bonnie Tyler is not afraid, though.</strong> Her expression says: my makeup is not only decorative, it is a protective suit of armor.</p><figure data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/giphy/instances/cj6mg5zls00023k5t7ahl6fao@published class=giphy data-editable=url></figure><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj6mfcrqq000b3k5t3e82nf4f@published data-word-count=54><strong>Okay, now things are getting crazy. </strong>A lot of things that don’t make sense but look sort of cool — which describes almost every music video from this period — happen over the next minute or so.
