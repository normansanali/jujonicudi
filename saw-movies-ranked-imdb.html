Focusing on the activities of terminally ill serial torturer and killer John Kramer (<strong>Tobin Bell</strong>), known as "the Jigsaw Killer," the series follows numerous victims, accomplices, and law enforcement agents tangled in his web of suffering.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With its complex and charmingly convoluted narrative, creative gore, and increasingly wild twists, the series maintains a strong fanbase. Saw's loyal fans on IMDb continue to support the saga, rating it highly, especially for the horror genre. Not every entry in the franchise is a hit, but <strong>fans on IMDb have given generous ratings to the best Saw movies</strong>.</p><h2 id=39-spiral-from-the-book-of-saw-39-2021><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>'Spiral: From the Book of Saw' (2021)</span></h2><h3 id=imdb-rating-5-2-10>IMDb Rating: 5.2/10</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/spiral-chris-rock.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The lowest-rated Saw film on IMDb is 2021's <a href=#><strong>Spiral: From the Book of Saw</strong></a>, directed by <strong>Darren Lynn Bousman</strong> and starring <strong>Chris Rock </strong>as protagonist Detective Zeke Banks. The film exists outside the story of the main series and delves into issues of police corruption, following Zeke and his rookie partner William Schenk (<strong>Max Minghella</strong>) on their mission to identify and catch a copycat of the Jigsaw Killer.</p><p>The film is the first in the series not to feature series legend Tobin Bell, and many feel the film suffers as a result. <strong>Spiral does not seamlessly blend into the Saw franchise due to the lack of Jigsaw</strong>, despite an intriguing premise with strong potential. Some argue that the film would have been better as a stand-alone project; <a href=#>perhaps the movie can be remade</a> as a straightforward crime thriller. However, it's clear Spiral fails to evoke the franchise's themes despite plastering its name on the title.</p><h5 class=display-card-title>Spiral: From the Book of Saw</h5><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>May 12, 2021</span> <strong>Director</strong> <span>darren lynn bousman</span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span>Morgan David Jones , <a data-id href=#>Samuel L.

The film follows Bobby (<strong>Sean Patrick Flanery</strong>), a con man who fabricated a memoir about being a Jigsaw survivor, as he is placed into a real deathly game. Advertised as "The Final Chapter," Saw 3D wraps up the stories of many of the series' recurring characters, including Dr. Lawrence Gordon (<strong>Cary Elwes</strong>) from the first film.</p><p><strong>Saw 3D is undoubtedly one of the weakest films in the franchise</strong>; nevertheless, it contains some grotesque traps and gore and uses its visuals to strong effect despite not being among <a href=#>the best 3D horror movies</a>. Bringing back Cary Elwes as Lawrence Gordon was a great choice and certainly elevates the film's impact on the series, but Saw 3D remains lazy, borderline nonsensical, and deprived of the originality that made the series so successful to begin with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Saw 3D">Saw 3D</a></h5>R <strong>Release Date</strong> <span>October 21, 2010</span> <strong>Director</strong> <span>Kevin Greutert</span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span>Tobin Bell , Costas Mandylor , Gina Holden , Betsy Russell , Tanedra Howard , Johnny Yong Bosch</span> <strong>Runtime</strong> <span>91</span><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Watch on Hulu</a></span></p><h2 id=39-jigsaw-39-2017><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>'Jigsaw' (2017)</span></h2><h3 id=imdb-rating-5-7-10>IMDb Rating: 5.7/10</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jigsaw-movie-image.jpeg><p><a href=#><strong>Jigsaw</strong></a>, directed by the <strong>Spierig Brothers</strong>, was released seven years after Saw 3D and featured a new apprentice and an addition to Jigsaw's origin story.
