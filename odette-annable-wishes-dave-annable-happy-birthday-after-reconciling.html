They <a href=#>tied the knot in October 2010</a> and welcomed their daughter in September 2015.</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed in October 2019 that the twosome <a href=#>had chosen to end their marriage</a> after nine years. “It’s with heavy hearts that we have come to the mutual decision to separate at this time,” the pair said in a joint statement to Us. “Our daughter is our primary concern and we remain committed to co-parenting her together. We ask that you please respect our family’s privacy at this time.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Odette-Dave-Annable-and-daughter.jpg><p>A few months after the breakup, the You Again actress <a href=#>admitted to having a tough go of it lately</a>. “I am incredibly grateful for the last 10 years,” she wrote <a href=#>via Instagram</a> on January 4. “They were the best of times and the worst of times. They shaped me, I grew. My goal for the new decade, in addition to promising myself to never stop learning and growing, is to try to be the best version of myself.”</p><p>Odette added, “If any of you have been going through a rough time and have been triggered by these holidays, or even this new year… I’m here for you. I get it. Baby steps. Time will heal. But also… #whatintheactualf–k.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Nearly six months after parting ways, Odette and Dave <a href=#>were quarantining together alongside their daughter</a>. The couple were tagged in <a href=#>an Instagram post shared by <strong>Stacy Ellington</strong></a> in April, where they celebrated a “virtual Passover” with other loved ones. The day before, they <a href=#>hopped on a Zoom call</a> to celebrate a friend’s birthday.</p><p>Odette and Dave <a href=#>confirmed their reconciliation</a> last month. The duo posted the same photo of themselves kissing on a beach, writing: “2020. It ain’t all bad news. #TheAnnables.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaonJWpwaZ5wKelmpqcmnq4tdKhnKxllJbDpnnAp6Wampyaeqmtz6mwZpqZp8GpsMCyZJqepJq%2Fbr7EnKanm5mhtq%2Bzjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./na-preorders-open-for-tpcast-wireless-adapter-for-htc-vive.html><span>←</span><span>North American Pre-Orders Opened for TPCasts Wireless Adapter for HTC Vive</span></a>
