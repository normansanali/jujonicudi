She said: <strong>"We were on a music video set all day together and then I went to one of his shows and then … yeah …"</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a4b741c8158d-gettyimages-609663868.jpg><p id=emjjXBg-gV_ data-wc=93>Despite their fiery start, <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Chrissy told&nbsp;Cosmopolitan</a>&nbsp;in 2014 that after their first meeting, she played it cool with the All of Me&nbsp;singer. <strong>"I left him by himself for a while.</strong> The worst thing you can do is try to lock someone like that down early on, then have them think, 'There's so much more out there.' I played it cool for a long time. <strong>Never once did I ask, 'What are we?</strong>' Marriage was never my goal because I've never been very traditional. <strong>I was just happy to be with him."</strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>How long have Chrissy and John been together?</h2><p id=eP3xqyvzkMi data-wc=41><strong>Since their first meeting in 2006, the couple has stayed together</strong>, although, Chrissy revealed that <strong>John did try to call it quits for a very brief moment</strong> which she spoke about in an interview with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Guardian&nbsp;in 2017.&nbsp;</a></p><p id=e2gkQJfw7eb data-wc=48>Addressing the situation on Twitter, she said:<strong>&nbsp;"It wasn't a typical breakup," she continued in a follow-up tweet.

"&nbsp;</strong>And the rest is history!</p><h2 dir=ltr>When did Chrissy and John get married?</h2><p id=eb9GEzfZr7y data-wc=67>The besotted couple<strong>&nbsp;tied the knot on 14 September 2013</strong>, with a<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;lavish and sentimental ceremony</a> in their beloved location,<strong>&nbsp;Lake Como, Italy at the Villa Pizzo</strong>. But their nuptials weren't all smooth sailing. A storm hit on the day, meaning that John's family wouldn't have made it to their destination wedding in time, so the couple decided to push back their vows until everyone had arrived.</p><p id=eA4lGS4uubl data-wc=51>Their special day saw the supermodel donning<strong>&nbsp;three unbelievable wedding dresses</strong>. The first was<strong>&nbsp;a flawless ivory strapless open-back tulle skirted Vera Wang ballgown.</strong> The second, was an <strong>on-trend fishtail style design, again in the perfect bridal hue of ivory,</strong> and also featured a micro-pleated bodice and sheared organza full skirt.</p><p id=e8K6b9cGEDi data-wc=62>The third was another <strong>Vera Wang number but this time it was in a dark romantic hue of crimson.</strong> Like the second dress, Chrissy opted for a mermaid style and, of course, looked so beautiful. The pair's special day included a performance from the groom and Stevie Wonder, while foodie Chrissy opted for a <a class=hm-link href=#>four-tiered carrot cake</a> layered with cream cheese frosting. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3ec7e68e1919-300c6ec82644-chrissy-teigen-wedding-night-zjpg.jpg><p id=eIPNNd_8sQfv data-wc=24>John proposed on Christmas 2011, during a trip to the Maldives, with a stunning cushion-cut diamond engagement ring set between two eternity bands. t</p><h2 dir=ltr>Did Chrissy Teigen take John's last name?</h2><p id=eHBTLrYWglSQ data-wc=53><strong>Chrissy did not take her husband's last name when they tied the knot</strong> for a very simple (and hilarious) reason which the brunette beauty clearly outlined to fans on social media. Replying to a tweet that read: "I'd really like to hear the reasoning behind women who won't take their husband's last name."&nbsp;</p><p id=eYgA1ftOg075 data-wc=38>Chrissy replied:<strong>&nbsp;"My husband didn’t even take his last name?"</strong> as John was born John Roger Stephens.

I was going to. just never got around to it&nbsp;</strong>and it isn't even the name he goes by. it wasn't some grand statement not to. I just don't see how the choice affects anyone else - why do people care so much!"</p><h2 dir=ltr>When did Chrissy and John become parents?</h2><p id=exBCssGCVf1P data-wc=54>Chrissy and John are the adoring parents to<strong>&nbsp;L</strong><strong>una, 11, whom they welcomed in 2016, Miles, four, whom they welcomed in 2018, and baby Estie whom the pair welcomed in January this year.</strong> The couple lost their son, Jack, in September 2022, and later welcomed a fourth child in June 2023 via a surrogate.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e55824ef33e5-chrissyteigen34030756561750954592230241419039442227616119n.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>What happened to John and Chrissy's son?</h2><p id=e7dwW_Nxv5EI data-wc=46>Chrissy was 20 weeks pregnant when she lost Jack due to a pregnancy complication.

It just wasn't enough."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4d5a00958e37-snapinstaapp1203731862019528479672668764568501221988351n1080.jpg><p id=exTrZYgxx_cK data-wc=64>"We never decide on our babies' names until the last possible moment after they're born, just before we leave the hospital," she continued. "But we, for some reason, had started to call this little guy in my belly Jack. So he will always be Jack to us. Jack worked so hard to be a part of our little family, and he will be, forever."</p><p id=ewwaZv1QdJJS data-wc=63>She continued: "To our Jack - I'm so sorry that the first few moments of your life were met with so many complications, that we couldn't give you the home you needed to survive. We will always love you. Thank you to everyone who has been sending us positive energy, thoughts and prayers. We feel all of your love and truly appreciate you."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/12c43b5fa1fd-snapinstaapp120293094818194588983372749412564277596565n1080.jpg><p id=efW2DiaJ_KgS data-wc=60>"We are so grateful for the life we have, for our wonderful babies Luna and Miles, for all the amazing things we've been able to experience. But everyday can't be full of sunshine. On this darkest of days, we will grieve, we will cry our eyes out. But we will hug and love each other harder and get through it."</p><p id=eOMAUN-wVW-W data-wc=21>John also shared Chrissy's statement on his Twitter account, adding, "We love you, Jack," alongside a string of love heart emojis.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Chrissy and John's fourth child</h2><p id=eJxy2HcLZm data-wc=78>Chrissy and John welcomed a fourth child, a <a class=hm-link href=#>baby boy</a> called <strong>Wren Alexander</strong>, via surrogacy in June 2023. Taking to Instagram to announce the arrival of their little one, Chrissy posted an emotional message which in part read: "For as long as I can remember, I've always wanted four children. As a little girl, 2 glow worms and 2 cabbage patch dolls were perpetually in my arms, helping me stir in my pretend kitchen, watching Alf with me.&nbsp;</p><p id=ezHpL6nNm9 data-wc=55><strong>"After losing Jack, I didn't think I'd be able to carry any more babies on my own. To be honest, I've personally blocked out a lot of my mindset during that time, but one clear memory is being surrounded by people who wanted to make sure I wouldn't go through that pain and loss again."</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d7ff0e2628c5-chrissy-teigen-baby-wren.jpg><p id=efseVOrZoU data-wc=42>Touching on her surrogacy experience, Chrissy went on to say: "In 2021, we reached out to a surrogacy agency, with our first correspondence inquiring about perhaps having 2 tandem surrogates, to each bring us a healthy baby boy or girl. Twins, kinda?!</p><p id=eNXGtTsapu data-wc=18>"Around this same time, we also met the most incredible, loving, compassionate surrogate we could ever imagine, Alexandra."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0da9fa74ee84-john-legend-holding-baby-wren.jpg><p id=e4ZpltkxRA data-wc=36>The first embryo they tried did not work but Alexandra went through surgeries to remove scar tissue and when Chrissy was through the first trimester of her pregnancy with Esti they discovered Alexandra was also pregnant.&nbsp;</p><p id=ef7JKdthmB data-wc=36>"Just minutes before midnight on June 19 I got to witness the most beautiful woman, my friend, our surrogate, give birth amidst a bit of chaos, but with strength and pure joy and love," penned Chrissy.</p><p id=e1Yb3SD9zS data-wc=17><strong>Want to keep up to date with the latest stories?<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our HELLO!
