But that being said, there are a handful of pieces that we reach for over and over again. We hate to play favorites when it comes to fashion, but some items are simply more reliable to have on hand — especially when <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">we don’t know what to wear</a>.</p><p>Staring at the mirror and trying to visualize an ensemble is time-consuming and stressful, so it’s best to have options that will always look good. Usually that involves our most flattering pair of jeans and some sort of cute top, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">like this one from WANGZHI</a>!</p><p>This type of <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">simple blouse</a> is the perfect complement to any trusted pair of jeans. Whether your go-to pair is high-waisted or a mid-rise version, this top will look great with the whole range. The silky material is easy to tuck into your jeans without it bunching up awkwardly, and the hem is long enough to wear with lower-rise pants. You can even get away with wearing this top with leggings!</p><p>The blouse itself has beautiful, balloon-style sleeves that cuff at the wrists, and a modest V-neckline that looks elegant with the loose fit of <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">the rest of its design</a>. The luxe fabric is silky, and can definitely be dressed up for a nice dinner or more formal occasion. Who doesn’t appreciate versatility?</p><p>You can score this blouse in an array of <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">different colors</a> and even some graphic print picks. This is the type of top to own in multiple hues, so you can rock it time and time again without repeating shades. Reliable, laidback and effortlessly chic, any shopper is sure to get plenty of use out of this top!</p><p><strong>Not what you’re looking for?
