Scheduled to kick off on November 7th, this partnership is slated to be one of the most exciting in the game’s history.</p><p>First and foremost, players will be introduced to the “Three Strikes” Limited Time Mode. In this refreshing gameplay twist, squads will be granted three opportunities to rise from defeat. Players can be downed but aren’t out for good until the entire squad meets its end. Only then does a squad lose one of its three chances. The quick-to-revive feature will add an interesting dynamic, ensuring rapid-paced matches where players can jump back into action almost immediately.</p><p>Another highlight is the suite of new skins. And it’s not just any skins, these are crafted in close collaboration with Post Malone himself. Special cosmetic items inspired by Post Malone’s favorites, including characters like Octane, Wraith, Horizon, and Lifeline, will be available. Exclusive stickers from Posty Sticker Packs will also be up for grabs.</p><p>For those looking for additional challenges and rewards, the event introduces “Camo Credits.” These can be earned daily, allowing players to unlock event-specific items. But that’s not all. Battlepass Stars and Sweepstakes Tokens can also be acquired using these credits. More details can be found below:</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Apex_Legends_x_Post_Malone_Event_Details></span>Apex Legends x Post Malone Event Details<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The <a href=# rel=noopener>biggest partnership in Apex Legends history</a> starts now, Legends.

Lose all three strikes and you’re out.</p><p>Players will respawn one POI away from where their squad wiped with the gear that was equipped at the time of the squad wipe, including:</p><ul><li>Armor and EVO progression</li><li>Weapons and attachments (except for mythic weapons)</li><li>Ammo, ordinance, and consumables</li></ul><p>Jump in Fridays through Sundays for 1.5 times the fun with:</p><ul><li>1.5x boost on all XP gained November 10 – November 12, 2023</li><li>1.5x boost on XP gained when playing Three Strikes November 17 – November 19, 2023</li></ul><h3 class=d3><span class=ez-toc-section id=COSMETICS_DESIGNED_WITH_POST_MALONE></span>COSMETICS DESIGNED WITH POST MALONE<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>Our “Iconic” tier cosmetics make their debut with skins, stickers, and bundles created in partnership with Post Malone for some of his favorite Legends including Octane, Wraith, Horizon, and Lifeline.<figure class=eapl-media__figure></figure><p>Unlock all 20 stickers from Posty Sticker Packs† to receive 3 Legendary stickers to tat up your heals and shields.</p><h3 class=d3><span class=ez-toc-section id=CAMO_CREDITS_REWARD_SHOP></span>CAMO CREDITS & REWARD SHOP<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Choose the right rewards for you with our event currency: Camo Credits.
