At that time, Jersey Shore’s cast was rewarded for <a href=#>all the partying they were doing</a> since whenever they did something extreme on camera, that resulted in more TV time and attention. Of course, when a group of people is encouraged to misbehave for years, it shouldn’t come as a surprise when they go on to struggle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Jersey Shore's' Ronnie Trolls Mike The Situation Following The Birth Of His Child</a></span></p><p>During the early seasons of Jersey Shore, Ronnie Ortiz-Magro and Sammi Giancola had an on-again, off-again relationship which eventually imploded. After Ortiz-Magro returned years later for the spin-off series Jersey Shore: Family Vacation, the world was introduced to the new woman in his life, Jen Harley. After being involved for a while and having a child together, Ortiz-Magro and Harley’s relationship came to an end. As a result, that left some people wondering, what really happened between Ortiz-Magro and Harley?</p><h2 id=were-ronnie-ortiz-magro-and-jen-harley-happy>Were Ronnie Ortiz-Magro And Jen Harley Happy?</h2><p>Thanks to the popularity of romantic comedies and dramas, some people have come to have a skewed view of what being in a happy relationship means. After all, there are loads of movies where two people who can’t stand each other and fight all the time suddenly realize they’ve been in love all along and belong together. In real life, however, it is ideal for partners to be passionate about each other but fighting and making up all of the time isn’t healthy for anyone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Most Famous On Again Off Again Relationships In Hollywood</a></span></p><p>From all accounts, Ronnie Ortiz-Magro and Jen Harley have had a tumultuous relationship ever since they first got together in mid-2017. During the first three seasons of Jersey Shore: Family Vacation, the show’s millions of viewers got to see a sampling of how explosive Ortiz-Magro and Harley could be as they were consistently seen fighting.</p><p>No matter how many times Ronnie Ortiz-Magro and Jen Harley were seen arguing during episodes of Jersey Shore: Family Vacation, that turned out to be only a hint of what was still to come. After all, during their relationship, Ortiz-Magro and Harley were involved in several truly alarming incidents.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-between-ronnie-ortiz-magro-and-jen-harley>What Happened Between Ronnie Ortiz-Magro And Jen Harley?</h2><p>During episodes of Jersey Shore: Family Vacation, it became clear that things like accusations of cheating and exchanging insults were a regular feature of Ronnie Ortiz-Magro And Jen Harley’s relationship. In an ideal world, however, things would have calmed down for the couple over time, especially once they welcomed their child into the world. In reality, however, there is a reason why people say when someone shows you who they are, believe them. After all, the drama in Ortiz-Magro and Harley’s only escalated over time and eventually turned violent which resulted in the police getting involved.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Ronnie Ortiz-Magro Still Friends With His 'Jersey Shore' Housemates?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In June of 2018, Jen Harley was arrested after she “was driving so erratically that three out of her four tires were flat” and “she drove over a median”. While that sounds bad enough, it turned out that things were much worse than they first seemed. After all, Harley was arrested for domestic violence. The reason for that is that after the couple began arguing as she drove, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">things turned violent</a>.</p><p>“Jen hit Ronnie in the face during the argument, and he asked [her to] pull over and let him out of the car. She stopped, and Ronnie tried getting out and got caught in his seatbelt. Jen started driving away, dragging Ronnie. Ariana was in the car at the time in the back seat. … Ronnie’s face was bloodied and bruised, and he’s got a nasty road rash.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Assuming that the aforementioned events played out as described, it is clear that Ronnie Ortiz-Magro was victimized by Jen Harley that night. However, on another night in October of 2018, Ortiz-Magro was the one who was arrested after he reportedly struck Harley and chased her with a knife. When police arrived at the scene to arrest him, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ortiz-Magro didn’t cooperate which resulted in him being tased</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amazingly enough, after those two events, things got physical again and that time, evidence of the event was streamed on social media. Around the same time that Ronnie Ortiz-Magro And Jen Harley’s child was born, she started a Livestream in the middle of the couple arguing. During the video, Ortiz-Magro could be heard saying “put your hands on me again” “I dare you”. Then Ortiz-Magro could be seen approaching Harley and evidently, he tried to wrestle her phone from her hands. Whether or not he eventually got hold of the phone, the Livestream ended soon after he tried to retrieve the device.</p><p>Thankfully Ronnie Ortiz-Magro And Jen Harley split up in 2019 but since they share a child, they remain a part of each other’s lives. With that in mind, it seems possible that Ortiz-Magro and Harley will be involved in more drama in the future but hopefully that won’t be the case. Fortunately, just like a lot of other <a href=#>stars who've gotten sober</a>, Ortiz-Magro has spoken about cleaning himself up, so hopefully, that is a positive sign of things to come.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Does Ronnie Magro From 'Jersey Shore' Have Fake Abs?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmqp%2Bju6qxjKipraGqYrqis9GoZJqmlGK3prqMoZirpJWufA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-did-radar-leave-mash.html><span>←</span><span>The Real Reason Why Radar Left M*A*S*H</span></a>
