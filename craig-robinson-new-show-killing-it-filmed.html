Killing It takes place in the Florida Everglades, and Episode 1 shows Craig killing a Burmese python with a car window. Though the 10-episode series certainly has some wild moments, the writers also illustrate messages about classism and the twisted version of what the "American dream" stands for today.</p><p>"The writers wanted to be a mirror to society," Craig exclusively told us. "[The show] is all about chasing the American dream."</p><p>In Episode 3, Craig gets scammed into attending a conference and shoveling out $1,000 to listen to a family talk about how they can help other people become rich.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Not unlike real life, with motivational speakers and pyramid schemes abound, the <a href=#>Office alum</a> explained that people are "blinded" and fall victim to these situations "because you see something different, and you don't want to see the negative part. You want to keep the narrative going."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is Peacock's 'Killing It' filmed? Craig Robinson talks shooting in New Orleans.</h2><p>Though the Peacock series takes place in South Florida, the series was actually shot in New Orleans. While thoughts of oppressive heat and mosquitos immediately come to mind, the actor told us that they luckily shot the series in the fall and winter.</p><p>"It was nice to be in New Orleans and not be sweltering," he said. While the cast and crew weren't melting under the Louisiana sun, Craig did reveal that production was postponed due to a few hurricanes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, one scene actually called for a hurricane, so production put Craig in a wetsuit under his clothes and he "had to act during this hurricane."</p><p>"You couldn't hear each other. It was beyond bananas insane to try to pull this off, but we did," he added.</p><p>Aside from battling the elements for the sake of the shoot, Craig also dealt with real snakes on set.</p><p>"We have some real snakes, some fake snakes. ... [For] the real snakes, the American Humane Society was always on set," he told us. "The wranglers will show you how to, you know ... there was no danger."</p><p>You can now stream Season 1 of Killing It on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmL%2BitcZmqaiamaPAsLqMp5ywZaOdvLh5yqKjpaGenHqqwIyfoKWllZk%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./corey-montiho-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-151686-html.html><span>←</span><span>Corey Montiho Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
