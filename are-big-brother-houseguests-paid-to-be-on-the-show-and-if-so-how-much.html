Most reality fans know that a bulk of our favorites — like The Bachelor and Bachelorette — don’t pay contestants for their participation. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Is Big Brother the same</a>, or does it pay its Houseguests when they appear on the show?</p><h2 id=h-are-big-brother-houseguests-paid data-injectable=false>Are Big Brother Houseguests paid?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=493 data-current-count=793 data-injectable=true>Big Brother isn’t your typical reality program. While there are plenty of reality competitions out there, Big Brother remains easily among the most prominent. It exists at the top of the pack alongside similar heavy-hitters like Survivor and separates itself from its peers with its unique contests and ceaseless surveillance. It also separates itself through its pay structure, which sees contestants earn money for their time — albeit quite a bit less than those Survivor favorites.</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=310 data-injectable=false>Before you feel too bad for them, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">know that Houseguests</a> are, in fact, paid to appear on the show. They make a range from their participation, depending on how deep into the season they last, but no matter how early that elimination comes, every Big Brother Houseguest earns at least a small sum for their time.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How much are Big Brother Houseguests paid?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Big-Brother-25-Scary-Verse.png><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=290 data-injectable=false>Big Brother Houseguest pay varies depending on how <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">successful each contestant is</a>, but it appears to largely fall in the same range. A former contestant on the program, Elena Davies, participated in season 19 of the series and later <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dished</a> on how much incoming Houseguests can plan to make.</p><p data-characters=716 data-current-count=1006 data-injectable=true>Every contestant on the show nets around $1,000 per week, according to Davies. That applies even to those who are booted out after just a few hours in the house — even though they didn’t last a full week, it seems CBS honors its word, and still cashes out the $1,000. Davies explained that the weekly stipend persists for anyone who lasts, week to week, in the series, and is added to any competition winnings. When Houseguests emerge from a specific competition victorious, they sometimes win a cash prize, which gives that weekly stipend a boost. Those who last through most, or all, of a season will typically see a payout more than $10,000 strong, particularly if they fared well in luxury competitions.</p><p data-characters=470 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=false>There is a catch, however. Those who actually <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cinch a win for their season</a> are unlikely to see those weekly payouts. That’s because the grand prize for a Big Brother win is a whopping $750,000, with the runner-up getting $75,000 and “America’s favorite” earning a still-impressive $50,000. Instead of earning that weekly stipend, the victor and runner-up both get their individual payouts, which total far more than they would have made on base.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yivsRmmaKfXZe%2FsMDHnqlmoJ%2BqwKaz1J6qratdpa6qsIytpmaalWK8r3nToZxmq5ikxG6tzZ1kop5dqLxutM6wZKatk518</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alicia-hannah-html.html><span>←</span><span>Alicia Hannah - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
