Before the breakup, Nathan lived in Star's $16.4 Million mansion in the Hidden Hills in California. On the other hand, <a href=#>Jeffree Star listed in mid-2021 his mega-mansion for sale and declared that he is leaving California</a> and moving out to Wyoming for good.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Seth Rogen Now Sells Weed and Vinyl For All Your Musical Marijuana Needs</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nathan-schwandt-started-showcasing-his-skateboarding-hobby><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Nathan Schwandt Started Showcasing His Skateboarding Hobby</span></h2><p>Schwandt occasionally posts videos and photos on his social media accounts performing his favorite hobby, skateboarding. He seemed to be enjoying the sport after the breakup when he was still in California, where he posted a video on his skateboard near the Walt Disney concert hall.</p><p>After moving to Grand Rapids, Michigan, Nathan continued to showcase his skateboarding on social media. In March 2020, Schwandt posted a photo where he was rock climbing a wall in Michigan. He captioned it, "Might have found a new hobby." During that time, <a href=#>new facts related to Jeffree Star's relationship with Nathan were still unfolding.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=schwandt-cozied-up-with-weed><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Schwandt Cozied Up With Weed</span></h2><p>Nathan has been smoking weed since 1999. Moreover, since Michigan legalized cannabis for recreational use in 2018, Schwandt has been revealing his love for the plant. Actually, Nathan was spotted several times after his breakup with Star partaking in the drug. Some fans were speculating whether Schwandt is considering starting a new weed business or if he is just enjoying it for fun.</p><h2 id=nathan-walked-away-with-an-attractive-new-style><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Nathan Walked Away With An Attractive New Style</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before dating Jeffree Star, Nathan worked as a pet shop employee in Michigan. He was an ordinary boy from Midwest USA. However, after meeting and dating Jeffree Star, <a href=#>Nathan transformed his looks</a>, started wearing luxury brands, dying his hair in fancy colors such as blue and green, taking care of his skin, and took his overall style to another level. It's worth saying that even after the breakup, Nathan maintained his unique and trendy style.</p><h2 id=nathan-schwandt-is-streaming-on-twitch><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Nathan Schwandt Is Streaming On Twitch</span></h2><p>Nathan recently began video-streaming on Twitch from time to time.

As Jeffree explained back then, Schwandt wanted to "detach" from this social world. Moreover, Nathan and Jeffree liked to DM people on social media for fun. As a result, fans would screenshot all of their conversations, circulate them and make a big story about them, which annoyed Nathan and pushed him to deactivate his Instagram and Snapchat accounts.</p><p>However, after the breakup, Nathan joined Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and other social media channels again. He now has more than 340,000 Instagram followers.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Fans Think Justin Bieber Is Over-Spending His $285 Million Net Worth, Here's Why</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYruiwMeapWark53EorrDrWShmaNir6axzWasqWWkpHq0tc2cnGagmah6o77EmqKuqF2strW0jKOcn56imrJuv9OaqWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-flashs-candice-patton-reveals-she-was-severely-unhappy-while-making-the-show.html><span>←</span><span>The Flashs Candice Patton Reveals She Was Severely Unhappy While Making the Show</span></a>
