Alanis Morissette and Ed Sheeran joined Luke Bryan as Lionel Richie and Katy Perry were off to London to perform at <a href=# rel>King Charles' coronation concert</a>.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Internet accuses Colin Stough of supporting 'Confederate flag' over his 'racist' resurfaced post</a></p><p><a href=# rel>'Typical country boy': 'American Idol' fans left unimpressed by Colin Stough's rendition of 'Simple Man'</a></p><h2 class=split>Colin Stough performs 'Hand in My Pocket'</h2><p>Colin sang his heart out on Alanis' song 'Hand in My Pocket'. He was a bit nervous as Alanis mentored the aspiring singer to make the performance more 'nasty'. Colin delivered his performance with an acoustic guitar. Alanis praised him and said, "I did not see that coming! Beautiful work." Sheeran complimented, "I love how it rocks out in the end. You are doing it in a way that makes it your own." Meanwhile, Luke added, He's just so damn cute, I don‚Äôt know what to do! You‚Äôve come so far."</p><p>However, Colin also delivered a rocking duet with Megan Danielle on Sheeran's song 'Dive'. The duo revealed that the producers put the duet partners together, but they got to choose their songs. However, the duet was hugely praised by the judges.</p><h2 class=split>'Colin doesn't deserve Top 5 placement'</h2><p>Colin has been embroiled in a controversy recently over his past social media posts. The aspiring singer has tried hard to impress the viewers with his stirring performances. However, many social media users didn't find Colin's performance worthy of the Top 5 sport and they believe that Warren should have advanced to the next round instead. A social media user wrote, "Colin, on the other hand, doesn't deserve that Top 5 placement. It's for Warren or Oliver." Another person tweeted, "I'm surprised America almost got this Top 5 right. Everything is right except that Colin's spot should be for Warren or Oliver."</p><p>"I would have preferred to have Warren at the top 5 over Colin #AmericanIdol," noted a viewer while another user added, "A good top 5 except for Colin. Just don't see how he made it without the producers putting their fingers on the scale. Guy was still making pitch mistakes in the top 8 performances. Both Warren and Haven had no pitch problems tonight. Shoulda has been one of them as 5th." One fan claimed, "Bro who keeps voting for Colin? Warren, Haven, and Oliver were all better than him!" while another viewer attacked country fans and asked, "People actually liked that Colin performance ??? Like, the country fans are THAT tone deaf??"</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Zachariah is the best male vocalist in the competition so he deserves it.</p><p>Colin, on the other hand, doesn't deserve that Top 5 placement.
