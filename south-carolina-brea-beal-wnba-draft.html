While she hasn‚Äôt always had a chance to show the offensive side of her game, it has always been there. After all, she and Candace Parker are the only three-time Illinois Gatorade Player of the Year award recipients and you don‚Äôt win that award while only excelling at one end of the court.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>This season, in lower volumes, Beal displayed an expanded offensive game. She attempted fewer than three 3s a game but hit 38 percent of them. And if you take out the Iowa Final Four game, she was 6-of-13 from that range during the NCAA Tournament. Is that enough to make a general manager that wasn‚Äôt interested suddenly change their mind about Beal? Probably not. But for a franchise that might‚Äôve been on the fence about how much work her offensive game would need, it was a step in the right direction. ‚Äî Jennings</p><h2>Where‚Äôs a potential landing place in the draft?</h2><p>Despite her expanded offensive game, I still see her ending up with a defensive-minded team, with Dallas and Indiana coming to mind. She would be a good fit in both of those systems as a big guard who can play immediately, fit into a system and defend well. Dawn Staley runs her program with a professional mindset, so franchisees know exactly what they‚Äôre getting when they draft a Gamecock ‚Äî someone who‚Äôs going to come to work, do their job and work to get better.</p><p>I don‚Äôt see the Wings using the No. 3 or No. 5 pick on Beal, but if the Fever don‚Äôt pick her up at No. 7, maybe they‚Äôd take her with their 11th pick. ‚Äî Jennings</p><h2>Required reading</h2><p>(Photo: Jeff Blake / USA Today)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57k2xvaW9gZXxzfJFsZmlsX2WBcL%2FOrquhZZOWv7C4yKeYZpqimq5ursSao2avnpeubrDRmp2tZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./owen-isabelle-landau-biography.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Owen Isabelle Landau Bio (Wiki)</span></a>
