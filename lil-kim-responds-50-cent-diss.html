The post isn’t the first time the “In Da Club” rapper made fun of Kim, as he <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>compared her to an owl back in July</a> after she performed at the BET Awards. Responding to that diss, Kim admitted that the comparison was “accurate,” but still had to call out 50. &nbsp;“50 Cent, I see u still in ur feels about that dinner date u asked me on that I had to turn down. Let it go, u have a beautiful girlfriend, I have a loving husband. Let it go.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>She didn’t give details about when this alleged date was supposed to happen, but hinted to fans that they would find out more in her forthcoming book. “I address that situation all in my book coming in November,” Kim wrote. “Make sure you go get it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lil-Kim-Claps-Back-50-Cent-Trolls-SS-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Lil Kim</a> and 50 Cent previously collaborated in 2003 on the hit song “Magic Stick,” but their friendship apparently fell apart quickly thereafter. By 2005, it was apparent the two had beef. “I don’t have a lot of respect for 50 cent because his music is hardcore…violent,” Kim said at the time. “I love his music sometimes, but I feel like in his personal life, his real life, he carries that on, and that’s not a great message, you know what I mean? I think he promotes it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5BsZqWhnGK4qrmMq5ysqJ%2BjsbR5lGlknJ2eqXqltdKsZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./everything-you-need-to-know-about-eduardo-escobars-parent.html><span>←</span><span>Everything You Need To Know About Eduardo Escobars Parent</span></a>
