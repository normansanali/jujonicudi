Redmond's half-sister, Tatum O'Neal, a <a href=#>former addict herself</a>, has also publicly aired her share of grievances about her tumultuous upbringing in her autobiography, <a href=#>A Paper Life</a>.&nbsp;But it was Griffin, Ryan's son from his first marriage, who has had the harshest words for his father.&nbsp;</p><p>After a violent confrontation between Griffin and Ryan, Griffin appeared on <a href=#>Larry King</a> with what was apparently a singular goal: trash the ever-living crap out of his dad. Among the long list of allegations, Griffin claims Ryan tried to shoot him in the face, attacked both him and his pregnant wife with a fireplace poker, repeatedly cheated on all of his wives, and not only enabled Redmond's drug use, but partook in it with him.&nbsp;</p><p>Griffin is no angel. He's dealt with drug and assault charges, not to mention the infamous 1986 boating accident he was involved in that resulted in the death of Francis Ford Coppola's son, Gian. Griffin was found not guilty of manslaughter, but convicted for negligence in the wake of the accident, reported&nbsp;<a href=#>The Washington Post</a>.</p><p>For his part, Ryan admits he wasn't the ideal father, telling&nbsp;<a href=#>Vanity Fair</a> that he used drugs throughout his children's upbringing. He called another of his sons, Patrick, "not likable" and confirmed that he was "sorry he had children." So, as far as his kids disgracing him in the public eye? Ryan O'Neal handles that all on his own just fine.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGphboFwr8SlnJtlm56xtHnDoqqgqpGYsqV5z5qpnqakqHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bunny-bennett.html><span>←</span><span>Bunny Bennett - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Nationality, Career, Facts</span></a>
