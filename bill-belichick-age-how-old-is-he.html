His parents, Jeannette and Steve Belichick, named him after Bill Edwards, a renowned coach in the College Football Hall of Fame who also happened to be his godfather. Belichick’s Croatian heritage can be traced back to his paternal grandparents, Marija Barković and Ivan Biličić, who immigrated from Draganić in 1897 and settled in Monessen, Pennsylvania. Upon their arrival, they changed their names to Mary and John Belichick as per the suggestion of immigration officers.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Growing up in Annapolis, Maryland, Belichick’s father served as an assistant football coach at the United States Naval Academy. Belichick credits his father as one of his most influential mentors in football, often studying the game alongside him. At a young age, he learned how to analyze game films by observing his father and the Navy staff in action.</p><p>Belichick completed his high school education at Annapolis High School in 1970, where he was classmates with Sally Brice-O’Hara, who would later become the Vice Commandant of the Coast Guard. During his time there, he actively participated in football and lacrosse, with lacrosse being his preferred sport. To enhance his academic standing, Belichick attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, for a postgraduate year. In recognition of his achievements, the school inducted him into its Athletics Hall of Honor in 2011, marking 40 years since his graduation.</p><p>Belichick’s coaching lineage can be traced back to Bill Parcells, under whom he began his coaching career in 1975 as an assistant for the Baltimore Colts. By 1985, he had become the defensive coordinator for Parcells’ New York Giants. Together, they achieved great success, winning two Super Bowls. However, Belichick eventually left to take on the role of head coach for the Cleveland Browns in 1991. After five seasons in Cleveland, he was let go following the team’s 1995 season.</p><p>Belichick then reunited with Parcells, first with the New England Patriots where they reached Super Bowl XXXI but fell short, and later with the New York Jets. However, his tenure as head coach of the Jets was short-lived as he resigned after just one day to accept the head coaching position with the New England Patriots on January 27, 2000.</p><p>Since then, he has led the Patriots to remarkable success, capturing 17 AFC East division titles, making 13 appearances in the AFC Championship Game, and reaching the Super Bowl nine times, winning a record six championships.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Belichick holds the distinction of winning the most Super Bowl titles of any individual in NFL history, with a total of eight victories. He has also finished as the runner-up four times, combining his time as both an assistant and head coach.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>As the NFL’s longest-tenured active head coach, Belichick has amassed an impressive record, with 31 playoff coaching wins, the most in NFL history, and 298 regular-season coaching wins, ranking him third all-time in the league. He also holds the second spot for combined regular season and postseason wins, as well as the second spot for most regular season coaching wins with a single franchise.</p><p>Belichick’s accomplishments have not gone unnoticed, as he has been named the AP NFL Coach of the Year three times, for the 2003, 2007, and 2010 seasons. He has also been recognized for his contributions to the game by being selected to the NFL 2000s All-Decade Team, NFL 2010s All-Decade Team, and the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team. Notably, he is the only active head coach to be included in the latter team.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-old-is-bill-belichick><strong>How old is Bill Belichick?</strong></h2><p>Bill Belichick is 71 years old.
