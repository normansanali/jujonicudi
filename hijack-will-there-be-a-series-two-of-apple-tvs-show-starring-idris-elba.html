However, although the streaming giant hasn't given the green light, it's certainly looking positive.</p><p id=ets3NLC21k data-wc=21><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Hijack star Rochenda Sandall has a very famous partner – and he starred in Happy Valley and Line of Duty</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=epuGaFeKHnL data-wc=17><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>The Morning Show season 3 trailer: Jennifer Aniston is ready to let the secrets come out</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/106357b590c3-idris-hijack.jpg><p id=elAH8TodnHL data-wc=32>Firstly, the show received a 92% score on Rotten Tomatoes, meaning audiences have clearly been loving the gripping plot. <strong>Secondly, the cast is more than up for taking part in more episodes…</strong></p><h2>What have the cast said about Hijack returning for a second season?</h2><p id=egkkVjM1av2 data-wc=39>In an interview with Variety, Idris teased the future of Hijack and admitted that he'd be keen to reprise his role of Sam. However, The Wire actor has one condition: that Sam does not get involved in another Hijack.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7c55d807049c-hijack-3.jpg><p id=eMUhS0j5ODx data-wc=39><strong>"I'd like that, but I just don’t want to put him on another hijack,"&nbsp;</strong>Idris explained. "I'm open to that character coming back. I think if people were compelled to like the character, then I'm in." This sounds promising!</p><h2>What are the fans making of Hijack?</h2><p id=eNRFrzt1FmH data-wc=39>Fans have been loving the series, which aired its final episode this week. Although one admitted it was a tough watch: "Too many cliffhangers. Too many twists and turns. This show is too tense. I have a headache. #Hijack."</p><p id=e7-LY2eJr7m data-wc=26>Another agreed, writing: "Hijack is the show of the summer. Y'all sleeping if you have not tapped in?

Pure thriller television. Sure, there are many moments that push the limit of coincidence & reality, but the show leans into its wildly improbable plot and it works so well when you’re locked into the episode."</p><h2>Who stars in Hijack?</h2><p id=e15_eqIi3nF data-wc=54>In addition to American Gangster actor Idris Elba appearing in the cast, there are some other big names fans have been loving.
