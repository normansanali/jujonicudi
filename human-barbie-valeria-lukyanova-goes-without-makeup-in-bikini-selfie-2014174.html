Her waist-length blonde hair hangs down her back, and she appears to not be wearing her usual doll-eye contact lenses. <a href=#>See more pics of Human Barbie.</a></p><p>Lukyanova is a controversial pseudo-star, not just because of her appearance but also because of her bizarre opinions and comments. Back in August 2013, during an interview with <a href=#>The Daily Beast</a>, she claimed she communicates with aliens. "We speak the language of light," she said. "I have learned a lot from my contact with them."</p><p>She has also said she is a teacher at the "School of Out-of-Body Travel," where instructors show students "how to leave their physical body and travel in their spiritual body, where you can visit any place on the planet and in the universe." And in the April issue of <a href=#>GQ</a>, she revealed that the idea of having children "brings out this deep revulsion" in her and seems unnecessary.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"What would you keep the children for?" she asked. "So they can get you a glass of water when you're on your deathbed?"</p><p>Her perceived counterpart, the so-dubbed <a href=#>Human Ken Doll <strong>Justin Jedlica</strong></a>, told the Daily Beast she's "interesting" — but he's not a fan of her schtick. "It is a little bit weird that she's trying to be stoic, emotionless," he said.</p><p>"She's a very pretty little girl,' he continued. "She knows how to do her makeup like stage makeup and give herself different features. The same techniques are used in theater all the time and with drag queens. I'm not saying she's a drag queen, but it's something completely different from me."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX53Crq3NZpmaqpKesm7CwKWcq6GRYrm2t9iapaiukWK0sLHSZq6irJikwrV5zJqinq2gYravecGioqKmmWLAprjFopxmamBmgXKDk2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gary-gaetti.html><span>←</span><span>Gary Gaetti</span></a>
