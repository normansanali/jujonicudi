"Marriage is not for everyone, but spiritually it is very necessary for me because I have a desire, a need to feel owned," she said, before clarifying: "Not physically or mentally owned.<strong> I</strong><strong>&nbsp;want to be owned spiritually. I want to belong to somebody.</strong> Marriage is a pact, a conspiracy of ownership.

"I know that people are interested but<strong>&nbsp;I don't even like talking about my relationship with Peter. And I guard it because it is very precious</strong>.

Their first son, Thomas, was born in 1987, and was soon followed by their second son Matthew in 1988.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>In a previous interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">The Telegraph</a>, Sarah explained that she got married after falling pregnant with her first child. "<strong>I'm a very traditional girl and was horrified at the thought of having a child out of wedlock</strong>," she admitted. "I didn't want a child of mine to be different or have fingers pointed at them. The marriage lasted for 10 years which was 10 years longer than it should have done."</p><p dir=ltr>Two years after she married her current husband, Peter, Sarah welcomed her third son, Joseph, in 2003.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Sarah is also a stepmum to Peter's three sons from his previous marriage to Penny Watt. Since Sarah tends to keep her personal life private, not much is known about her children.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr><br></p><p dir=ltr><br></p><p id=eVMRLYIZNt></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5uaGltZGt8qrrSopueZaOWv6K0jKWYp5uRqLWqvsRmn6illWK5qrLEZp2apZ%2BqwG601KyZmqaUYsCwutJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-swift-leonardo-dicaprio-feud-facts.html><span>←</span><span>Do Taylor Swift And Leonardo DiCaprio Have A Secret Feud?</span></a>
