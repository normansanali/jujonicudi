Margot mentioned the reality hoax show Jury Duty, which Ryan had watched but not enjoyed as much as Margot.</p><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=528 data-injectable=true>Ryan highlighted his own reality TV favorite — 90 Day Fiancé, as well as its spin-off 90 Day: The Other Way — in which Americans travel move to their fiancé’s home country before deciding whether or not to wed. Ryan is clearly a vocal fan of the franchise, as Margot replied “oh yeah! you love that!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-could-90-day-fiance-inspire-ryan-gosling-s-performance-as-ken data-injectable=false>How could 90 Day Fiancé inspire Ryan Gosling’s performance as Ken?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Just-Ken.jpg><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=679 data-injectable=true>90 Day Fiancé is home to some of the biggest, most eccentric personalities on reality TV. Many stars on the show have a real flair for drama and love attention — which seems to be the case with Ken. From the promotional clips alone, Ken clearly has a flamboyant dress sense and would do anything to be in Barbie’s spotlight, which he is often unsuccessful in achieving.</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>As suggested by the song “I’m Just Ken,” Ken is utterly obsessed with Barbie — to the point that he doesn’t know who he is without her. Ken’s feelings, however, seem unreciprocated. As Ken points out, it’s “Barbie and Ken”, but never just Ken.</p><p data-characters=535 data-current-count=821 data-injectable=true>In the trailer, Ken travels with Barbie to “the real world,” and things seem to get pretty tense between the pair as they cause trouble and end up arrested. A frequent source of drama within 90 Day Fiancé is one party having to live in the shadow of their partner, especially if there’s jealousy, or isolation — the latter particularly experienced by recent immigrant participants. Moving somewhere new is always a huge source of tension, as couples can be broken up by the strain of adapting to an unfamiliar culture.</p><p data-characters=201 data-current-count=201 data-injectable=false>These two franchises may be pretty different, but if Ryan Gosling is a big binge-watcher of the reality series and its spin-offs, there are plenty of bad boyfriends he could use as inspiration for Ken.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXafGorqMoKaspJmjtG68zq2cp6yZlrmtxYyuqp6cXW59brDAsmSfoZGjsKZ506hkqaqVpa6zsYyfpqtlkpa%2Fo7XEaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-is-ted-binion-wife-sandy-murphy-net-worth-2022-where-is-she-now.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Is Ted Binion Wife Sandy Murphy Net Worth Where Is She Now?</span></a>
