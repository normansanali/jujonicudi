"Having both the ability and the instinct to protect your family, to stand up for yourself — that is vastly important, that's not the full spectrum in any way. I think kindness and empathy and thoughtfulness and sensitivity, those are also huge factions of what it means. I think we can all kind of take a step back and stop trying so hard and just be good human beings."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Photo by Alberto E.

The actor attributes that response to the "polarizing" time in the country, wherein we're more in need of empathy than ever.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Right now, unfortunately, I think we got a lot of the wrong people holding the mic," he tells InStyle. "People are coming at things from polar opposites, whereas I think, really, where we most live is much more in the middle. I think empathy comes from having an open mind, from rubbing elbows with people that think differently than you, act differently than you, believe in different things than you, and that shouldn't be viewed as a challenge to you, it should be viewed as one of the things that makes this country really, really beautiful, that we can sit down with people who think differently than we do."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bernthal says the chance to work with Bullock was a major draw of the film, as was working with director Nora Fingscheidt, who he called an "unbelievable filmmaker."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Sandy, she's just the best, she's a hero, she's super-kind," he said about Bullock.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Unforgivable is currently playing in select theaters, and will be released on Netflix on Dec. 10.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8mopWaalae7tbTApWSipqSav7e1xLBkrqaWpL%2BotdWamaWdXaW%2FprnInqme</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dawsons-creek-cast-where-are-they-now.html><span>←</span><span>Dawson's Creek' Cast: Where Are They Now?</span></a>
