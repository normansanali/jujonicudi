Jackson had to fight for his purple lightsabre</p><p>The 73-year-old actor, who played Mace Windu in ‘Star Wars’ Episodes I, II, and III of the blockbuster franchised and explained why he wanted his character to have a purple lightsaber.</p><p>When asked how the purple lightsaber came about on the ‘Happy Sad Confused’ podcast, he answered: “Ask George [Lucas]. In Episode II, there’s that huge scene in kind of like a war stadium. There’s all these Jedi out there. And when I was reading it I was like ‘how am I going to find myself in this?’ So I thought, ‘different colored lightsaber!’ So I said, ‘George, can I get a purple colored lightsaber?’ [And he said,] ‘they’re green, they’re blue.’ I said, ‘what, seriously, that’s it?’ And that was the end of the conversation.”</p><p>Though the ‘Avengers’ star thought he’d lost the fight at this point, he revealed the moment when director George Lucas, 77, told Samuel he’d changed his mind.</p><p>He explained: “But then we finished shooting reshoots, I had to fly back to London, and he was like ‘I want to show you something,’ and I was like ‘what?’ So he shows me a purple lightsaber. But then he says, ‘it’s already causing a s***storm online, so I don’t know if I’m going to keep it,’ and I was like ‘really? Come on! And how do people online know anyway?’</p><p>“But sure enough, when the movie opened, he was like, ‘okay. You get to keep the purpe lightsaber.’ Because in episode one, I never even got to pull it.”</p><p>The ‘Pulp Fiction’ star also confessed that he believes Mace Windu is still alive, and would hinted that he could reprise his role in the ‘Star Wars’ universe.</p><p>Samuel revealed: “I think [Mace Windu] is alive somewhere. … There’s a huge history of people with one hand returning in ‘Star Wars.’ The only person I’ve ever said that to, about coming back, was Bryce Dallas Howard. I just did a movie with her, and she directs episodes of ‘The Mandalorian.’ So I was like, ‘do you think you might be able to hook a brother up? I mean, you like me, right?’ And she’s like ‘I love you, you’re amazing!’ So I said ‘put me back in it.’ I’ll learn to use the lightsaber left-handed!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOrJimrZWheq15yZqapKufo3qprcNmq6hllp60qcCMn6arZZiewG681KunpZ1dobaotNOsmJudomK2r3nSrZirZaeWv7R7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nfl-russell-wilson-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Russell Wilsons Net Worth, NFL Contract, NFL career, Endorsements, Girlfriend, and More</span></a>
