I find it deeply satisfying.”</p><p>The 7th Heaven alum went on to explain her process, saying she’ll use a built-in shelf to rest the food on when she needs her hands for other things. Jessica said she often take yogurt or a coffee in while she’s scrubbing up.</p><p>“I like to take a bite or a sip and put it on the ledge, and then you do your thing,” she explained. “You wash your hair — keep the soap out — that’s a big deal.”</p><p>“The only tricky thing is when you’re chewing, you got to keep your mouth closed because I still like to get under the water while I’m chewing, and for whatever reason, I want to open my mouth at the same time and spit water,” Jessica went on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/two-hollywood-a-listers-might-be-to-blame-for-delayed-britney-spears-memoir.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Britney Spears' 10 Most Popular Songs, Ranked (According To Spotify)</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Britney Spears is a worldwide superstar and one of the top 10 selling female artists ever, but how does she rank on streaming platforms?</span><p>She also revealed exactly why she started eating in the shower, admitting it has to do with wanting to escape her two sons and have some me time.</p><p>“Chew, do not open the mouth [and] do not let the shower water in.

The couple began dating in 2007 before tying the knot on October 19, 2012, in Italy. The couple welcomed their first child, a son named Silas, in April 2015. Their second child, name Phinneas, was born in 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They may have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">renewed their vows in 2022</a>, but there are an increasing number of reports that Biel and Timberlake’s marriage is on the rocks.</p><p>“It’s a nightmare that just won’t go away,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source told</a> <a href=#>In Touch</a> last fall . “It’s been very hard on their marriage.”</p><p>The source said Britney’s allegations have also brought up the couple’s past trust issues, including when Justin was accused of cheating with actress Olivia Munn in 2010. He was later caught holding hands with his Palmer co-star Alisha Wainwright during an evening out; though Timberlake apologized, he denied anything inappropriate happened.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Jessica has buried her head in the sand for so long when it comes to Justin’s sketchy past,” the source continued. “She refused to believe he’d cheated on her with Olivia, but that thing with Alisha was a tough pill to swallow because there were the pictures. If she hadn’t seen it with her own eyes, maybe she wouldn’t have believed it, but it was staring her in the face.”</p><p>For now, Justin and Jessica appear to be putting on a loyal front.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqujnrCiecGinKVlp5q2s7CMrZ%2BippdiwKm71p6pZquZobKvwIyjrKysmaN6tbXMm5yrpJGgsm6%2B1Kamq6tf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jerry-seinfeld-howard-stern-comments-relationship.html><span>←</span><span>Jerry Seinfeld Slams Howard Stern, Complicating Their Otherwise Positive Relationship</span></a>
