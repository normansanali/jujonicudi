Practically every Aubrey Plaza fan out there is begging Tim Burton to hire the Parks and Recreation star for Wednesday‘s sophomore run. The internet’s long been of the opinion that Plaza would make for the perfect adult Wednesday, and now folks are hoping Burton makes this a reality, should <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix do the right thing</a> and greenlight a second run.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Okay but Aubrey Plaza needs to be the elder Wednesday – that is all.</p>— HeckYesJess (@Jsahaya) <a href=#>December 1, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=88 data-current-count=388 data-injectable=false>Flashforwards to Wednesday’s future would be the perfect way to make this happen.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=688 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#Wednesday</a> has been a fun ride thus far!￼</p><p>That said, <a href=#>@Netflix</a> will have missed, in my opinion, an obvious opportunity if season two doesn’t leap forward 20 years to check in on the heroine in her late 30s – and tap Aubrey Plaza for the role.</p>— rainydaymatt (@rainydaymatt) <a href=#>December 1, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=115 data-current-count=115 data-injectable=false>Or, you know, Netflix can just keep the show going until Wednesday reaches adulthood and then Plaza can take over.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=415 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>I think they should continue the Wednesday series with eventually Aubrey Plaza playing an adult Wednesday</p>— coco (@biggy_smallss) <a href=#>November 30, 2022</a></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/the-addams-family.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Wednesday_S1_E1_00_08_38_23R-scaled.jpg><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=241 data-injectable=false>If a role as an older Wednesday isn’t on the cards, though, then Plaza would still be perfect casting as another, hitherto unknown, member of the Addams clan.
