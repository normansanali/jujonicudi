She learned she was pregnant just seven days after being married, and following the birth of her first kid, it became increasingly harder for her to care for the unborn child. She claimed that another difficulty she faced was breastfeeding.</p><p>“I thought my breastfeeding efforts were failing. My home was in disarray. I thought I was a lousy dog owner. I feared a movie I was set to star in just a few weeks after giving birth since I could hardly concentrate to read the script. I was certain I was a terrible actress.</p><p>She said that she had struggled with depression.</p><p>And worst of all, I had the distinct impression that I was a terrible mother—not just a bad one.
