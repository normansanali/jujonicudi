Similarly, he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p><p>McAtasney strangled Stern and threw her body off a bridge in a robbery that resulted in $10,000.

The case garnered widespread attention as it shed light on the sinister plot devised by Stern’s former high school classmates, McAtasney and Preston Taylor.</p><p>The pair planned to kill Stern for the money she had recently discovered and stage her car on the bridge to make it look like she committed suicide.</p><p>Their plans were initially brought to light by Anthony Curry, a former Neptune High School classmate and horror filmmaker. He revealed details of a conversation McAtasney had with him on Thanksgiving 2016.</p><p>Curry disclosed that McAtasney had shared his plans to kill Stern and rob her of the large sum of money she had recently found. At the time, Curry did not take the conversation seriously until Stern went missing.</p><p>Investigators got Curry to tape a conversation with McAtasney about Stern secretly. Curry met with McAtasney and recorded him talking about the murder for 30 minutes.

Taylor’s portion of the loot amounted to $3,000, but the money was antiquated and damaged to the extent of being worthless.</p><p>Also read: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Camila Mendes Met Gala 2023: What Did She Wear?</a></p><p>The prosecution built a strong case against McAtasney, thanks partly to the secretly recorded video in which he confessed to the murder in chilling detail.</p><p>McAtasney recounted the killing, timing it with an application on his cell phone, and revealed that it took him half an hour to choke Stern to death while her dog sat and watched.</p><p>He was disappointed with the poor quality bills he got from killing Stern, so he buried the cash at Sandy Hook.
