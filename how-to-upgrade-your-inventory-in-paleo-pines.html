This can be frustrating, as it is possible to lose an essential item as you have forgotten where you put it. The good news is that <strong>players can upgrade their inventory by visiting Orani in Pebble Plaza</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Paleo-Pines-Orani.jpg><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=309 data-injectable=false>Players can find Orani, to the left of Agami’s Stall, and is the town’s fashion designer and stylist. At first, Orani won’t offer to upgrade your inventory, as <strong>you must purchase a few outfits from her first</strong>. After buying a few outfits, Orani will then make the offer to upgrade your pockets.</p><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=603 data-injectable=true>When accepting the offer, know that doing so <strong>requires you to hand over Fiber</strong>, so make sure to have some before speaking to Orani. Accept the request for upgrading pockets and give her the Fiber to increase your inventory’s size, allowing you to carry more items than you could previously!</p><p data-characters=50 data-current-count=50 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong><a href=#> All Paleo Pines Dinosaur Skills Explained</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>How to Get Fiber in Paleo Pines</h3><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false>Since you need Fiber to upgrade your pockets with Orani, you must first learn how to get it. Fiber is obtained by clearing debris on your ranch with Lucky, your trusty partner dinosaur. You can also get Fiber as a quest reward from certain requests posted on the Pebble Plaza mission board.</p><p data-characters=378 data-current-count=718 data-injectable=false>Not only is having Fiber helpful in upgrading your inventory, but it is also a great way to make money. You can sell Fiber for a profit, as well as other materials as well. Visit Mario, who will purchase Fiber from you and the other building and crafting materials like Stone and Wood. Selling to Mario is a great way to make enough money to buy the required outfits from Orani.</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
