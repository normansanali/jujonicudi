Explored</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Let’s find out “TD Jakes Comment About Women And Controversy” Bishop TD Jakes was born in South Charleston on June 9, 1957. He started his journey to the megachurch as the pastor of a storefront church, despite the fact that he is now well-known as the megachurch’s leader.</strong></p><p>Women are not praised for their femininity, according to a recent comment from the successful businessman, <a href=#>honorable author</a>, and wife’s lifelong companion. You are commended for being strong, rough, nasty, unpleasant, aggressive, hostile, and possessive in today’s society. There is a lot of admiration for this quality.</p><p>He made a statement that sparked a lot of discussion on social media.</p><h2 id=what-did-bishop-td-jakes-say>What Did Bishop TD Jakes Say?</h2><p>After becoming viral and getting new media publicity one month later, a statement that Bishop T.D. Jakes sent out for Father’s Day is now under review.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112></span>The 65-year-old pastor of The Potter’s House in Dallas speaks out against the modern-day sociological order that he claims is raising women to be men and destroying families in a sermon titled “Real Men Pour In,” which was highlighted by The Christian Post.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.trendingpal.com/uploads/2022/7/7ebd2687-65bf-4781-94c9-088e9ef388c0.webp><p>The charismatic preacher places a strong emphasis on the “divine order” or hierarchical structure that men and women are meant to conform to, as stated in 1 Corinthians 11:3: “The head of every man is Christ, the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God.”</p><p>Bishop TD Jakes talked about a controversial issue in today’s society: how children of both sexes are taught in schools to reject traditional gender roles.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114></span>In a sermon delivered on Father’s Day, Bishop T. D. Jakes reminded the congregation of his church that the black family is in danger of extinction because modern-day women place less importance on their femininity.</p><p>Black men are told to give up their masculinity and take on a more feminine identity, which is celebrated and rewarded.</p><h2 id=bishop-td-jakes-net-worth>Bishop TD Jakes Net Worth</h2><p>Bishop T. D. Jakes is an author, filmmaker, and American religious leader with a net worth of&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>USD 25 million</a>. He is a spiritual guide who can be approached from many different angles. His personality is complex and expansive, and he has a lot of different sides to it.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116></span>On the other hand, the parish he owns has a net worth of two hundred million dollars. A trust that T. D. Jakes established oversees and controls the administration of all of Parish’s property and resources.</p><p>We are attempting to convey that T. D. Jakes exercises direct and indirect control over assets with a combined value of two hundred million dollars. These assets consist of many private jets, homes, and television stations, among other things.</p><h2 id=bishop-td-jakes-wife>Bishop TD Jakes Wife</h2><p>T.D. Jakes has remained faithful to his wife, Serita Jakes, who has been by his side through both difficult and joyful times.</p><p>Jakes devotes a significant portion of his sermons to the topic of marriage. As the other half of a relationship that has lasted for almost four decades, many people look to him for direction and guidance on marriage-related issues. He rarely forgets to credit his wife for her critical role in maintaining their union for the past four decades.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.trendingpal.com/uploads/2022/7/32d62b6c-8c35-4a04-bc50-55bb5abc37f9.webp><p>The first time Serita and Jakes crossed paths was at a revival at Serita’s church. Greater Emmanuel Temple of Faith in Charleston, West Virginia, was fortunate enough to have Jakes on staff as an associate pastor.</p><p>Jakes and Serita first crossed paths not long after Serita’s baptism. As a new convert, he guided her in the right direction and helped her find her spiritual footing. During that period, the couple not only became romantically connected but also formed a close personal bond.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOrZtmopGgsrR5wqikpp2eqXqirs6uq2avn6Kyr3nAp5tmm5%2BjwbO71Z6prLFf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./slavica-ecclestone-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Slavica Ecclestone Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
