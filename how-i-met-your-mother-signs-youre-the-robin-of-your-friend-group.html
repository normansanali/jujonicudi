She became an important part of Ted's friend group, even though exes typically have to break up with partner's friends as well. Every friend group as a Lily, Marshall, Ted, Barney, and Robin. Here are the characteristics that your typical Robin will relate to.</p><h2 id=you-don-t-get-along-with-girls-except-one><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>You Don't Get Along With Girls (Except One)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/lily-and-robin-how-i-met-your-mother.jpg><p>Robin wasn't the kind of a woman who would find herself relating to fellow ladies. She wasn't very loving towards them, with an exception of Lily. Lily essentially adopted Robin when she came into the friend group and put a lot of work in building their friendship, while Robin just kind of went along with it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Robins of the friend group are typically loved to no end, even when they don't reciprocate as often as the rest would like.</p><h2 id=you-keep-your-emotions-to-yourself><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>You Keep Your Emotions To Yourself</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Robin-How-I-Met-Your-Mother.jpg><p>Robin doesn't wear her heart on her sleeve and she rarely wants to talk about what is bothering her, even though she can't hide that something is wrong. Robin is not a fan of big displays of affection and she certainly won't pour her heart out to anyone who would listen.</p><p>A notable exception was the time when Barney came to her place and they watched the "Sandcastles in the Sand" video. She was really upset when her teenage crush broke her heart again, which also led to Barney and Robin hooking up for the first time. It pays off to be vulnerable, so all you Robins out there should definitely work on letting other people in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=you-are-a-little-bit-of-a-bully><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>You Are A Little Bit Of A Bully</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/robin-yelling-at-patrice-on-how-i-met-your-mother.jpg><p>As seasons progressed, Robin fell victim to brutal Flanderization, yelling at poor sweet Patrice every time she opened her mouth as if that is socially acceptable. Robin didn't like her and she essentially bullied her. "Nobody asked you, Patrice", she'd scream at her.</p><p>If you're anything like Robin, you're sometimes not capable of holding back and you unleash your anger and frustrations on an innocent by-stander.</p><h2 id=you-love-traveling><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>You Love Traveling</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/robin-and-enrique-iglesias-on-how-i-met-your-mother.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whenever any serious relationship talk came up, Robin wouldn't negotiate. She wanted to travel the world and work abroad and that was that. She didn't really do much traveling during the series, though. It was more of a fantasy of hers. An exception that comes to mind is when she went to Argentina where she met Gael, played by a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrity guest</a> Enrique Iglesias.</p><p>Do you find yourself talking about all the traveling you want to do or you actually do the most traveling of all the friends in your group? If so, you're Robin; especially if you prefer to go on these adventures alone rather than with your friends.</p><h2 id=you-put-your-career-first><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>You Put Your Career First</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/robins-job-at-metro-news-one.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Robins are the social scientists of the group, and ambitious ones at that. Robin's career goals were her #1 priority in life. Her life in NYC depended on her job because otherwise, she'd be deported back to Canada, so she had more than one reason to climb that corporate ladder at Metro News 1.</p><p>When she was still covering silly stories for the news, she felt a little bit ashamed. When she finally became an anchorwoman, she also gained considerable confidence. If your job fuels your sense of worth a lot, then you're the Robin.</p><h2 id=everything-you-want-comes-true><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Everything You Want Comes True</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/how-i-met-your-mother-ted-and-robin-finale.jpg><p>Robin is a pretty lucky gal, considering she changes her mind a lot, yet always gets what she wants anyway. Her on-and-off relationship with Ted is the perfect example of this phenomenon. Even though she rejected him time and time again, she regretted it when he got married. Needless to mention, she did the same with Barney.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Robin doesn't really invest much in her friendships; she thinks blessing her friends with her presence is enough to keep the group going. Think about it: do you just take and not give back? If so, it would be best to start appreciating your friends better. Don't be a Robin!</p><h2 id=you-struggle-with-commitment><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>You Struggle With Commitment</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ted-and-robin-how-i-met-your-mother.jpg><p>Robin's commitment issues probably stem back to her childhood: she clearly has a lot of unprocessed father issues that influence the way she relates to men in her adult life.</p><p>Robin loves attention and validation, but as soon as she gets close with a potential partner, she shies away since she is afraid to be intimate. Are you an avoidant type yourself, but don't hide it behind unhealthy coping mechanisms like Barney does? Yep, you're the Robin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=you-don-t-care-about-gender-roles><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>You Don't Care About Gender Roles</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/robin-smoking-a-cigar-on-how-i-met-your-mother.jpg><p>Robin is not a girly girl: she loves to drink whiskey, smoke cigars, play poker, and shoot guns. Her father wanted desperately for her to be a boy and he raised her like one, even though she wasn't into things like hunting and backpacking in the Canadian wilderness.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="These Are The Best How I Met Your Mother Episodes, According To IMDb" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These Are The Best How I Met Your Mother Episodes, According To IMDb</a></span></p><p>You're the kind of a person who doesn't believe in traditional gender roles.
