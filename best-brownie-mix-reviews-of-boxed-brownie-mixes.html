We went to work, testing all of the <strong>most popular and readily available brownie mixes on the market to find out the best brownie mix</strong>.</p><p>I knew that I needed to bring in the big guns. This couldn’t be just a small brownie taste test. I had to bring in some of my foodie friends to be my judges, to determine the brownie mix winner.&nbsp; This was a legit brownie taste test to see which brownie would be declared the winner.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Best-Brownie-Mix-Taste-Test-8.jpg alt="The BEST Brownie Taste Test.

I studied a phenomenon called “group think” in college and know people can be swayed by other people’s opinions. So it had to be less talking and more eating!&nbsp; They were happy to oblige because I was offering them BROWNIES.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Best-Brownie-Mix-Taste-Test-9.jpg alt="The BEST Brownie Taste Test.

I also encouraged them to take notes and describe in detail their takes on the brownies. The brands were left anonymous and each type of brownie mix was given a number so we could track the scores.&nbsp; I gave them a few descriptive words to help while judging such as moist, chewy, fudgy, cakey, dense, too sweet, spongy, oily, weird aftertaste, fake flavor, lacks flavor, weird&nbsp;aftertaste, etc.&nbsp; They also had to circle their favorite chocolate brownie mix. <strong>The results may surprise you!</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Best-Brownie-Mix-Taste-Test-10.jpg alt="The BEST Brownie Taste Test.

They wanted more chocolate flavor! They felt it was bland and overly dry. This didn’t receive any horrible scores but the lack of memorability and just okay flavor landed it in the bottom spot.</p><p><strong>#7:&nbsp; Pillsbury Chocolate Fudge Brownie Mix</strong> — the reviewers agreed that this brownie mix created a dry brownie. It was hard and crunchy and even had an oily aftertaste. This calls for the most oil out of all of the brownie mixes and the reviewers could taste way too much oil. Most reviewers thought this was just an average brownie and nothing special.</p><p><strong>#6:&nbsp; Duncan Hines Dark Chocolate Fudge Brownie Mix</strong> — the reviewers thought this was a dense, fudgy brownie. Some thought it was a little too soft and fudgy in the middle. It received good scores for being moist, but some reviewers thought it was too oily.</p><p><strong>#5:&nbsp; Betty Crocker Fudge Brownie Mix</strong> — This is your average brownie mix — it didn’t receive any terrible reviews but it also didn’t receive any 9 or 10’s. The reviewers thought this was super sweet and chewy.&nbsp; They agreed that it was a little bland and needed more chocolate flavor. It ranked high in texture but low in good chocolate flavor.</p><p><strong>#4: Nestle Toll House Brownie Mix —&nbsp;</strong>This one ranged high for its chocolate flavor. The addition of chocolate chips was loved by the reviewers.&nbsp; It ranked high in flavor but the texture was just average. Half of the reviewers thought the brownies were too dry.</p><p><strong>#3: Great Value (Wal-Mart Generic Brand) Fudge Brownie Mix —&nbsp;</strong>the underdog and least expensive brownie mix killed it in the brownie mix challenge, much to the surprise of the judges.&nbsp; One judge even gave it a perfect score and deemed it the favorite.&nbsp; It consistently received a few solid 8’s, a few 9’s, and one 10.&nbsp; It also received a 2 and several 4’s so it wasn’t a favorite across the board.&nbsp; Most reviewers like the soft, chewy texture with flaky top. They enjoyed the fudgy flavor. Some thought it was slightly artificial tasting and wouldn’t eat it again. It scored well enough to nab the #3 spot. What a shocker!</p><p><strong>#2: Betty Crocker Triple Chunk Brownie Mix —&nbsp;</strong>The top 2 brownie mixes were the winners by a good margin. Reviewers loved this brownie mix and it received an average of 8.2 points. Reviewers loved the added chocolate chunks which gave it great chocolate flavor. They also loved the chewy texture. This was many reviewers pick as their ultimate winner. I personally have bought this brownie mix for years so I am not surprised that it received such positive accolades.</p><p><strong>#1: Ghirardelli Triple Chocolate Brownie Mix —&nbsp;</strong>It was neck and neck to the very end. I tallied up the very last judge’s sheet and this Ghirardelli brownie mix won by 1.5 points.&nbsp; Reviewers said it had a melt-in-your-mouth chewy texture and had phenomenal chocolate flavor. They loved the addition of chocolate chips to give authentic richness.&nbsp; The high-quality Ghirardelli chocolate put this brownie mix over the top.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Best-Brownie-Mix-Taste-Test-3.jpg alt="The BEST Brownie Taste Test.
