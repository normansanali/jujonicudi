However, Soaps.com may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes.</p><p>And with that, Days of Our Lives has sent another couple off into the sunset for what we hope is a taste of happiness. After a disastrous delay that nearly killed them, Tripp and Wendy left Salem for Hong Kong on the Monday, April 29 episode. Wendy may, finally, feel safe again without Tripp’s family drama hanging over her head.</p><p><strong>More</strong>: <a href=# rel=noopener>The real threat to Konstantin is [spoiler]</a></p><p>It’s an exit that the show teased a while back, with Tripp and Wendy almost heading off to be with Wendy’s parents on the other side of the world, only to be drawn back into Ava’s drama — and danger! The following kidnapping at the hands of Clyde’s henchwoman/lover, Goldman, traumatized Wendy enough to convince her that they really did need to get out of Salem and the two finally made good on their plans to leave for Hong Kong.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/steve-kayla-goodbye-tripp-wendy-days-jj.png alt="Steve and Kayla sit in their living room with Tripp and Wendy" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>They’re calling it an “extended trip” and promised to return, but also mentioned that Tripp would be taking Mandarin classes over there and volunteering as a doctor. And once the young couple started talking about Steve, Kayla and Ava visiting, it started to sound more and more like a move than a trip.</p><p>So while this likely isn’t the last we ever see of them, they could be gone for some time. We do know, however, that Victoria Grace was at the 15,000th episode celebration, which means she’ll probably be back in some way by December when the show airs.</p><p><strong>More:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Celebrate with the cast of&nbsp;Days&nbsp;after 15,000 episodes [Photos]</a></p><p>Lucas Adams, on the other hand, wasn’t spotted at the celebration, but that doesn’t necessarily mean Wendy comes back without him. The actor simply may not have been around for the party. We’ll just have to stay tuned to see if and when the two make their return to Salem.</p><p><strong>Keep track of all the exits with our photo gallery of <a href=# rel=noopener>who’s leaving&nbsp;Days of Our Lives</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmnZmpqHqwsoyorKtlnJ7Dpr%2BOnKamoZ6cwG6tzZ1koKeZo7S0e5Zrbm9sYGS2tHnLrpqaq12WsaK50marq6GgpXqtscCvoKefXau2pMDOq6CaZZenrqSxjLCcp5ypZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./702965-chelsea-green-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Chelsea Green Net Worth 2023: What Is The WWE Superstar Worth?</span></a>
