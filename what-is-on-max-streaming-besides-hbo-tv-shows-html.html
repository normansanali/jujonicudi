The streamer formerly known as HBO Max changed to just “Max” overnight in the <a href=#>middle of a week</a> in May, forcing us to <a href=#>download</a> yet another app (annoying). While the name still does not make sense, the streamer, now filled with Warner Bros. Discovery’s entire library, has a lot to offer in every category, the ultimate capitalist-empire streamer. Its broad television offerings are admittedly confusing, even to experts on the Warner Bros. Discovery library, particularly at a time when the studio is actively <a href=#>killing its darlings</a>. Max doesn’t make it any easier, as the design of the library itself forces users to scroll rather endlessly to find specific shows or channels. The chaotic service boasts series from Food Network, HGTV, the CW, Cartoon Network, Magnolia Network, Discovery, Max (formerly HBO Max) originals, and more, but that also means there’s a plethora of television to discover and rediscover on Max. Let this be your guide to the best of the weirdest streamer on the market.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cljedadzb000m3b6vjxknu100@published>Adventure Time</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljedaear000s3b6vu1gr06vj@published data-word-count=9><strong>For: </strong>Friday nights after you’ve just had an edible.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljedaecw000u3b6v8p0p0jfy@published data-word-count=52>Trippy, cute, colorful, and weird AF, the Adult Swim animated series documents the adventure times of Finn the Human and Jake the Dog in the Land of Ooo, which is filled with a bunch of fantastical weirdos including emo vampire queen Marceline, <a href=#>the Ice King</a>, Princess Bubblegum, Lumpy Space Princess, and more.</p>Adventure Time <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Max</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cljedaf8x00183b6vb1u74nqz@published>Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown&nbsp;</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljeiawb700ie3b6v7bamr9bw@published data-word-count=9><strong>For: </strong>Gourmet globe-trotting from the comfort of your couch.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljeibkha00jh3b6vvwh1v1dh@published data-word-count=64>Anthony Bourdain travels the world to get to know cuisines and people from different countries and cities.

Unlike most home-design shows, this one is serialized: Each season focuses on one big home-renovation project that unfolds episode by episode, with smaller projects sprinkled throughout the season. It’s also completely unlike any other home-design show in that it stars a Midwesterner with the earnestness of Drew Barrymore interviewing a guest. Like any designer, Stoffer has her go-tos. She loves brass hardware, subway tile, and a glossy finish, but unlike most designers with television shows, her perspective is truly unique, and she always stays true to the style of the home as it was originally built. For example, in the second season, Stoffer chooses to keep the radiators in a kitchen because they add to the old charm of the 1930s home. If she were a Property Brother, those would have been gutted on day one.</p>The Established Home <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>max</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cljedae1i000o3b6vilttwyi8@published>Love & Death</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljei6r9k006c3b6v86br67w2@published data-word-count=13><strong>For: </strong>When you’re feeling gossipy but also in the mood for true crime.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cljeia65m00ge3b6v2lfvkpi9@published data-word-count=102><a href=#>Love & Death</a> follows the life, crime, and trial of Candy Montgomery, a Texas housewife in the 1980s who killed her friend Betty Gore with an ax after having an affair with her husband.

The Fox teen drama has one of the best pilots in television history. The series — or at least its stellar, 27-episode first season — is a pillar of early-2000s civilization. You could hardly leave your home in the winter of 2003–04 without being asked, “Summer or Anna?” The series influenced pop culture by infusing indie music into the mainstream and, for better and worse, made nerds who read comic books look cool through Adam Brody’s portrayal of Seth Cohen.

Mad Men. The Wire. Breaking Bad. The Vampire Diaries often gets lost among this list of the greatest television dramas of television’s Golden Age at the beginning of the century. This is for several reasons: It was a television show made for teenagers on a new network for teenagers, and by the time it premiered in 2009, Twilight had saturated the culture whether you liked it or not, so a lot of people were sick of vampires already. It was also not that serious. While The Vampire Diaries is no Mad Men (or is it?), it is thrilling, clever entertainment that is only occasionally dumb, with fun performances and lore that actually makes sense when the incredibly hot actors — all with eyes more sparkling than the other — deliver it in tight expository dialogue.</p>The Vampire Diaries <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>max</a><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckb173z54000012ol1nvh94h8@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The 30 Best TV Shows on HBO and Max</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckaprt6og006npoy6tfxak3ne@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The 30 Best Movies on HBO and Max Right Now</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clhyymly000000pd84ynwmnqa@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>HBO Max Is Now Just Max.
