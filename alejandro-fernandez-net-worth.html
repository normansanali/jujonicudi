Aleandro performs both Mexican folk music and Latin pop. With more than 30 million of his records sold globally, he is one of the best-selling Latin music artists in history. Additionally, Fernández has won Latin Grammy Awards, and in 2005 was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Alejandro Fernández was born on April 24, 1971 in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico. He is the son of famed actor and ranchero singer <a href=#>Vicente Fernández</a>, and made his first public appearance at the age of five in one of his father's shows. He has a sister named Alejandra, and two older brothers named Vicente Jr. and Gerardo. In the late 90s, Vicente Jr. was kidnapped by an organized crime group, and had one of his fingers severed as a warning to his father, who allegedly paid a large ransom to have his son released.</p><h2 id=career-beginnings><strong>Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>Fernández released his debut self-titled album in 1992; it contained the songs "Brumas," "Equivocadamente," and "Necesito Olvidarla." He subsequently embarked on a tour of Mexico and the United States. In 1993, Fernández released his second album, "Piel de Niña"; a significant success, it launched the hit songs "Cascos Ligeros" and "A La Vera del Camino." The following year, he released the album "Grandes Éxitos a la Manera de Alejandro Fernández," on which he sings classic songs from such artists as Agustín Lara, <a href=# title="Armando Manzanero Net Worth">Armando Manzanero</a>, and Luis Demetrio.</p><h2 id=international-breakthroughs><strong>International Breakthroughs</strong></h2><p>In 1995, Fernández achieved international recognition with his fourth album, "Que Seas Muy Feliz." It launched the track "Como Quien Pierde Una Estrella," which became his first global hit. Fernández continued his success with his 1996 album "Muy Dentro de Mi Corazón," which earned him a Grammy Award nomination for Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album. Meanwhile, it spawned the hit songs "Moño Negro," "Nube Viajera," and "Abrazame."</p><p>Fernández had his biggest hit in 1997, when he released his sixth studio album, "Me Estoy Enamorando." The album was significant for marking a change in his musical style, as it was more pop-oriented than his previous ranchera-inflected works. This creative decision paid off, as the album reached number one on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart, spending 12 weeks in that position. Moreover, each of its four singles – "Si Tú Supieras," "En El Jardín," "No Sé Olvidar," and "Yo Nací Para Amarte" – made it to number one on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart. Fernández went on to receive a Grammy nomination for Best Latin Pop Performance for the album.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-247434 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/GettyImages-106694491.jpg alt="Alejandro Fernández Net Worth" width=594 height=473 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-247434 class=wp-caption-text>Getty Images</p><h2 id=further-albums><strong>Further Albums</strong></h2><p>Fernández made a return to ranchera music with his 1999 album, "Mi Verdad."
