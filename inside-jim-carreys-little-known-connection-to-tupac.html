So the Canadian funnyman took it upon himself to write letters to Shakur to cheer him up during his incarceration.&nbsp;</p><p>According to a <a href=#>report</a> on their epistolary friendship, the "Bruce Almighty" actor believed that the charges against the star of "Poetic Justice" star were bogus, and wrote Shakur letters meant to make him laugh to make his sentence less of a hardship. Another <a href=#>report</a> from earlier this year suggests that Carrey has consistently refused to divulge the nature or content of their letters.&nbsp;In fact, the creators of the "Letters of Note" anthologies have <a href=#>tweeted</a> in the past that they reached out to Carrey to share his letters with Shakur and were met with radio silence. "Letters of Note" is famous for publishing the <a href=#>private correspondence</a> of noted personalities from history, such as&nbsp;Zelda Fitzgerald, Tom Hanks, Fidel Castro, Leonardo da Vinci, Amelia Earhart, Elvis Presley, Mick Jagger, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Carrey isn't the only person to send letters to Shakur in prison. Queen of Pop Madonna&nbsp;<a href=#>exchanged letters with Shakur</a> as they were dating at the time, and some of those letters have actually been made public.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcW5kZ396e8inqqKclWK3qrmMnJirqpWuwG64yK2rpZ1doLuww81mmqimnpqwtbXOp2Stp12pwrGtwmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chuck-woolery.html><span>←</span><span>Chuck Woolery Net worth, Age: Kids, Weight, Bio-Wiki, Wife</span></a>
