During this decade, the maximalist <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>interior aesthetic</a> was everywhere—particularly in wealthier homes, where mirrored walls and oversized aquariums were standard fare. If you ache for the era of Wham! t-shirts and Memphis Design, take a trip down memory lane and discover these hilarious things rich people had in their homes back in the '80s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/intercom-system.jpg><p>How could you tell if someone was rich in the '80s? Well, instead of simply shouting up the stairs or walking from room to room, they'd have a series of intercoms that made it possible to ask what was for dinner or if anyone had fed the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>cat</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/heart-shaped-tub.jpg><p>While cheap motels and expensive '80s homes have few things in common, the heart-shaped Jacuzzi is an exception to the rule. And good news: If you're eager to make one of these beauties your own,&nbsp; they're <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>still available today</a> for just over $2,000 apiece.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/memphis-design-sofa.jpg><p>Brightly-colored, geometric furniture from Memphis Group is about as '80s as interior design gets. And while Memphis Group stopped producing furniture in 1988, the company's pieces are still beloved enough to fetch handsome sums—like nearly $6,000 for <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>this bold chair</a> via Pamono. A collection of <strong>David Bowie's</strong> Memphis pieces was posthumously auctioned by <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Sotheby's</a> in 2016, earning a total of $1.76 million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/neon-overhead-light.jpg><p>Though they may not have provided enough light for reading or writing, if you were truly wealthy in the 1980s, your home had at least one neon light sculpture illuminating a room. Because when you're rich, who needs traditional overhead <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>lighting</a> anyway?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/central-vacuum-attachment.jpg><p>If moving a vacuum from room to room is simply too onerous a task for you, the '80s has an amazing solution: central vacuuming. Back in the day, all you'd have to do is attach your vacuum's hose to a port in one of your rooms and voila! It was a wondrous way to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>clean the floors</a> without having to lug the entirety of a bulky machine around with you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/novelty-phone.jpg><p>While <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>cell phones</a> were still relatively uncommon in the 1980s, tastemakers of that era had the next best thing: <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>novelty phones</a>. Whether you called your friends on a device that looked like a hamburger or hit up your significant other via a pair of lips, you knew you were from a fancy family in the '80s if your phone was cleverly disguised as something else.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/basement-bar.jpg><p>If your parents liked to have a good time in the '80s, then it's likely that your basement was as much a bar as it was a hangout space. After all, what's more fun and glamorous than mixing Tom Collinses with the dulcet tones of your kids playing Atari in the background?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/red-leather-furniture.jpg><p>The primary color trend that dominated the '80s extended well beyond accessories, textiles, and tiles. In many posh homes of that era, you'd find plenty of oversized red leather furniture, a style more commonly associated with <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>movie theaters</a> than mansions by today's standards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/07/glass-block-wall.jpg><p>Were they windows? Were they design accents? Truthfully, nobody knows. What we do know is that while they may be anything but fashionable today, in the 1980s, glass block walls were commonplace in all of the most au courant homes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/round-bed.jpg><p>Sure, you couldn't find sheets to fit them properly, and they weren't exactly great for a room's feng shui, but round beds were a staple in upscale homes in the '80s nonetheless.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/apple-lisa-2.jpg><p>While there's nothing inherently funny about having a home computer, the amount of money folks were willing to shell out for the Apple Lisa's limited functionality was <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>pretty hilarious</a>. These computers, which could perform only a few tasks (largely related to word processing and calculations) and frequently crashed, sold for just a few bucks shy of $10,000 when they hit the market in 1983—not exactly an affordable addition to most <a rel="noopener noreferrer" data-replaced=801 href=#>home offices</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/mirrored-walls.jpg><p>If you love to look at yourself as much as Narcissus does, then the mirror-heavy aesthetic of the '80s might have just tickled your fancy. From closet doors to the occasional ceiling, mirrored surfaces were as ubiquitous in the 1980s as mullets were.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/seashell-bathroom-accent.jpg><p>While you can pick up a dish of sea shells for your <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>bathroom</a> today at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Target</a> or TJMaxx, in the 1980s, beach-inspired bathrooms were kind of a big deal. In some particularly egregious cases, these washrooms even combined two '80s trends: wallpaper borders and seaside motifs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/crystal-cabinet.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Baccarat</a> must have been making a killing in the '80s, because back then, crystal cabinets were in practically every upper-middle-class home. And why wouldn't they be? It's not like you could keep your collection of goblets and crystal chess pieces on any old shelf.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/home-aquarium.jpg><p>The fascination with fish hit fever pitch in the 1980s when countless upscale homes began to use aquariums as living room centerpieces Why wouldn't you want an obtrusive, expensive, hard-to-maintain design element that's prone to flooding in the middle of your room?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/gold-toilet.jpg><p>Maximalism was a major theme of 1980s design right down to the era's bathrooms. If you went to a rich person's home in the '80s—and we mean a really rich person—you might just have found yourself sitting on a literal golden throne. And it appears that our current president is a fan of this '80s design trend: When <strong>Donald Trump</strong> asked to be loaned a <strong>Van Gogh</strong> painting from the Guggenheim to hang in the White House, artist <strong>Maurizio Cattelan</strong> offered him one of his solid gold toilets to borrow instead, as the museum confirmed to <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>The Washington Post</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/dot-matrix-printer.jpg><p>Ask anyone who was around in the '80s and they'd tell you that if you wanted to truly deck out your home office back then, a dot matrix printer was the best way to do it. The only downsides to the technology? Expensive reams of hard-to-use paper that had to be threaded properly, waiting forever for documents to print, and finding space on your desk for a machine the size of a small car… just to name a few.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/etched-shower-doors.jpg><p>One surefire way to tell you were in a rich person's home during the Reagan era? Their <span data-href=https://bestlifeonline.com/ways-youre-showering-wrong/ data-target=_blank data-rel="noopener noreferrer">shower</span> surround. While your average middle-class home might have had a curtain or plain glass doors enclosing the space, your fancy friend likely had frosted <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>glass shower doors</a> etched with images of plants or underwater scenes, like this one from Home Depot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/fake-fruit-bowl.jpg><p>A bowl of fake fruit. You couldn't eat it or store it too close to the stove—and yet, your house in the '80s wasn't fashionably decorated without it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/fancy-sunroom.jpg><p>Sure, your extravagant sunroom might not have had <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>air conditioning</a> to get you through the summer, and its lack of heating might have made it unpleasant to spend time in during the winter months, but those three months a year during which it was comfortable enough to utilize the space were nothing short of bliss.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/circular-window.jpg><p>Seaside inspiration was an essential component of '80s architecture. Thanks to this nautical trend, porthole-inspired windows were just another implausible—and uncurtainable—part of well-to-do '80s homes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/glass-staircase.jpg><p>The only thing more perilous than a steep staircase? One surrounded by panes of glass prone to shattering. Of course, that didn't keep '80s interior designers from installing them in countless homes anyway.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/tasseled-valance.jpg><p>It wasn't simply enough for wealthy families to cover their windows in the '80s. If you wanted your home to look au courant, your windows had to be outfitted in oversized drapes with matching valances adorned with gems, tassels, and ornate tiebacks. The more over-the-top, the better.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/geode-collection.jpg><p>For a brief period in the '80s, this upgraded version of your favorite childhood collection was a perfectly acceptable—and even elegant—home decoration. All you had to do was set a handful of amethysts and agates on your coffee table and you were practically ready for a House Beautiful spread.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/macrame-plant-hangers.jpg><p>The plant-heavy trend of the '80s didn't just apply to textiles and wallpaper. If you wanted a truly elegant home, you needed a handful of macramé-hung <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>plants</a> in your bathroom. (With the steam from the shower, it was practically a greenhouse anyway, right?)
