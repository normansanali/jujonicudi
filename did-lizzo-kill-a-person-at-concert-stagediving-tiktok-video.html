There was a wild rumor that began to swirl around that the pop artist and flautist killed a concertgoer at one of her shows after she decided to jump into the crowd.&nbsp;</p><p>The rumor started after <a href=# rel>Dababy's stage-diving stunt at Rolling Loud</a>. After throwing his shoes into the crowd to take away as a memento, the 'Givin' what it's supposed to give' rapper dived into the crowd and wouldn't go back on stage despite his bodyguards trying to pull him out of the crowd. He also went on a transphobic and homophobic rant after which he's being canceled by industry folks as well as fans. You can read about it <a href=# rel>here</a>. Stagediving is very common at concerts and fans love it when their favorite artists do it. There's video evidence of Dababy pulling off this stunt, but Lizzo, who is also <a href=# rel>Harry Styles' bestie</a> as he often leaves flirty messages on her photos, says the rumors about her are baseless.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Lizzo shows off cleavage in leopard Savage x Fenty robe after slamming body-shaming troll on social media</a></p><p><a href=#>Did Azealia Banks fat-shame Lizzo? Azealia's fiance Ryder Ripps fired for body-shaming his boss Zara Larrson</a></p><h2 class=split>Did Lizzo kill a fan while stage diving?</h2><p>No, Lizzo did not kill a fan at her concert and she certainly did not stage dive. She decided to address the matter on TikTok where she's wildly popular. “I’ve seen a lot of annoying things about me on the Internet, but the thing that bothers me the most is this rumor that I stage dived at a concert and killed somebody,” she said. “Like that rumor… it’s a lie, first of all! I’ve never stage dived in my life," she added while proceeding to show fans that the only diving she does is on her bed.&nbsp;</p><p>"Ya'll really gon put that on my motherf****ng name? Like, I know I'm big but, b***h, I'm not that f****ng big," she said. Lizzo double-downed on what she said by doing a belly flop on her bed to prove that even if she did decide to stage dive, no one would end up dead. Apart from being a fabulous musician, Lizzo is also loved as a role model for body positivity and self-love. She also has a great sense of humor and she uses it to set the narrative straight about herself whenever required.&nbsp;</p><p>The 'Juice' hitmaker receives a lot of comments about her weight from haters on social media and in March, Lizzo posted a video to mock her trolls. She started off by addressing the question what it's like to be "obese every day". Looking at her camera and pretending that she's about to break into a million tears, Lizzo said, “I wake up into my obese bed. I have to get like a king bed because I’m so obese. I put on my obese Louis Vuitton house slippers, and I walk into my massive, obese bathroom and I just stare into my wall-to-wall, obese mirror and lather myself in the most obese, expensive oils and creams," she said.</p><p>"And – oh God – I walk into my obese, gorgeous, mid-century modern kitchen, and by the time I’ve made it into my kitchen, I’ve already made another obese million dollars. My bank account is so fat. My bank account is so obese, and, like, I tried to put it on a diet but she’s just so stubborn, like, she won’t listen," she said in the video which is one of the best ones she's put out for the haters.
