Not to be confused with lower abbdominoplasty or tummy tuck, it can also occur in men and women who have been overweight and have lost a considerable amount of weight.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'Women seek it because they are on the eternal quest for perfection. With women being constantly bombarded with images in the media of perfect bodies and the current trend of designer abs, abs have never been more visible and more revered.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'You can treat this area with radio frequency assisted lipo suction, which also tightens everything up preventing post-operative loose skin and minimises scarring. Cases resulting from significant weight changes might need surgical correction under general anaesthesia involving the removal of excessive skin</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'It is a walk-in-walk-out treatment with negligible downtime requiring the wearing of compression pants for six weeks. The cost would be approximately £1485. More serious cases need hospital admission and general anaesthesia and therefore the costs are considerably higher with scars healing over a period of ten days.;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Dr Guillem says it is becoming very fashionable and popular at his clinic in the Costa del Sol where women are spending a lot of time on the beach.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The latest body insecurity comes after the 'bikini bridge' became a social media trend last year.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>There were even facetious comments posted promoting the 'benefits' of possessing a 'bikini bridge' such as 'fitting an iPod into your bikini bridge' and 'getting a smoother tan line from your bikini bridge'.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Speaking to MailOnline at the time, body image and wellbeing expert Katie Lowe said: 'The bikini bridge is just another example of horrendous thinspiration that encourages young women to develop poor body image and self-esteem.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'Images like this used to be constrained to pro-anorexia websites - which are themselves dangerous, damaging communities for young men and women to encourage disordered eating behaviours.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'Bikini bridge or otherwise, we need to learn that bodies are beautiful in all shapes and sizes - and encouraging young women to strive towards something like this is an unhealthy result of a body shaming culture.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn6Ybm1xcGVkmrC60manrpqZqHqtrdOeqq1lkqSxunnFnpylZaOauad5wqilrJuZpMK0ecCbpq6sXp3Brrg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kanye-west-remembers-michael-jackson-in-a-special-way-video.html><span>←</span><span>Kanye West Remembers Michael Jackson in a Special Way [VIDEO]</span></a>
