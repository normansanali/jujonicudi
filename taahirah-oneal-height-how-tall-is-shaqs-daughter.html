<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Taahirah ONeal Height: How Tall is Shaqs Daughter?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Taahirah O’Neal is the eldest daughter of NBA legend Shaquille O’Neal and his ex-girlfriend Arnetta Yardbourgh. She is also a communications analyst at PepsiCo and a social media marketing specialist. But how tall is she? And how does her height compare to her famous father and siblings? In this article, we will reveal the truth about Taahirah O’Neal’s height, and how it affects her personal and professional life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Taahirah O’Neal’s Height: The Facts</h2><p>Taahirah’s height is also much lower than her father’s, who is a towering 7 feet 1 inch (2.16 m) . Shaq is one of the tallest players in NBA history, and has a shoe size of 22 . Taahirah’s mother, Arnetta, is also taller than her, at 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m) .</p><p>However, Taahirah is not the shortest member of her family. She has five siblings from her father’s side, four of whom are half-siblings from Shaq’s marriage to Shaunie Nelson. Among them, the youngest, Me’arah O’Neal, is the shortest, at 5 feet 4 inches (1.63 m) . The others are Myles O’Neal (6 feet 2 inches or 1.88 m) , Shareef O’Neal (6 feet 9 inches or 2.06 m) , Amirah O’Neal (6 feet 2 inches or 1.88 m) , and Shaqir O’Neal (6 feet 6 inches or 1.98 m) .</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Taahirah O’Neal’s Height: The Myths</h2><p>Despite her modest stature, Taahirah O’Neal’s height has been the subject of some rumors and exaggerations over the years. Some fans and media outlets have claimed that she is taller or shorter than she actually is, or that she wears heels or flats to alter her height. For example, some websites have listed her height as 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m) or 5 feet 3 inches (1.60 m) . However, these claims are not supported by any evidence, and are likely based on inaccurate measurements or comparisons.</p><p>Another myth about Taahirah O’Neal’s height is that it has affected her career or relationship choices. Some people have suggested that she is too short to work in the communications or marketing field, or that she is intimidated by taller men. However, this is not true, as Taahirah has proven her competence and confidence in her profession, working for a global company like PepsiCo. She has also dated men of different heights, such as her ex-boyfriend, who was 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) .</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Conclusion</h2><p>Taahirah O’Neal is a successful and beautiful woman who has achieved her goals and dreams in life. Her height is 5 feet 5 inches (1.65 m), which is slightly below average for an American female, and much lower than her father and siblings. However, her height has not defined her identity, but rather a part of her physical appearance that complements her personality and talent. Taahirah O’Neal’s height is not a limitation, but rather a unique feature that makes her stand out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7Jfqa6itMirmKFln6OyoriMoZyin5ipeqm71marmqScYra0edKhmKqrXZmutrPHrZyrZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sport-ball.html><span>←</span><span>Sport Ball - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</span></a>
