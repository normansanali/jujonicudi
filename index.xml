現在の嫁である森下愛子さんとは結婚して30年以上経つおしどり夫婦ですが、今の嫁さんにたどり着くまでにかなりの遠回りをしてます。
吉田拓郎さんは1972年の26歳の頃に最初の結婚をします。
初婚から幾度も離婚を繰り返して、今の奥さんと再婚して、ようやく落ち着いたのです。
今日は吉田拓郎さんの歴代の嫁さんと、その嫁との間に生まれた子供について書いてみたいと思います。
過去の奥さん達と離婚してしまった理由についても書いてみたいと思います。
吉田拓郎の結婚・離婚を時系列でまとめる。四角桂子、浅田美代子、森下愛子。 年代 結婚・離婚 1972年(26歳) 四角桂子と結婚 1974年(28歳) 四角桂子との間に娘「彩」誕生 1975年(29歳) 四角桂子と離婚 1977年(31歳) 浅田美代子と2度目の結婚 1984年(38歳) 浅田美代子と2度目の離婚 1986年(40歳) 森下愛子と3度目の結婚 吉田拓郎は過去に3度の結婚と2度の離婚。子供は初婚の相手に１人だけ誕生 吉田拓郎さんは１９７２年に四角佳子さんと結婚するも、１９７５年には離婚しています。
四角桂子さんとの結婚生活は3年でした。
１９７７年に浅田美代子さんと再婚するも、１９８４年には離婚しています。
浅田美代子さんとの結婚生活は７年でした。
１９８６年の４０歳の頃に結婚した森下愛子さんと現在までに結婚生活は続いています。
子供は初婚の四角桂子さんとの間に娘が一人生まれているだけです。
吉田拓郎と最初の嫁・四角桂子の馴れ初めと娘・彩。離婚理由は不倫と誤逮捕 吉田拓郎さんの最初の結婚は1972年の２６歳の頃で相手は歌手の四角桂子さんです。
２人の馴れ初めは１９７１年５月３０日に、愛知県岡崎で開催されたフォークグループ「六文銭」とのジョイントコンサートで、吉田さんは「広島フォーク村」というサークルの活動の中で、四角さんと知り合ったのです。
初めて会った時から、ほう、いい女だなあって思ったよ。だいたい俺は惚れっぽい性質だしね。でもちょっと小生意気な感じもしてね。
こういう感じの女は一発やんなきゃわからないって思ったんだよ。よし、いっちょチャンスを作ってやろうと狙いはつけたわけよ
フォーク歌手として出会った吉田拓郎と四角佳子さんですが、当時の吉田拓郎さんは売れる前でお金がなく、荒れた生活を送っていました。
四角さんの吉田さんの最初の印象は良くなかったようです。
ひと言でいえば、すご～くイヤ～な感じの男だってところかな。紹介されてもね。素足に運動靴をはいて、楽屋のテーブルの上に座ったまま足をブラブラさせながら、”アッ”とか”ヘッ”とか言うだけなの。
普通の人なら”よろしく“ぐらい、ちゃんと立って言いそうなものでしょう。それも相手はウラ若き乙女だったんだから・・・
吉田さんは四角さんが所属する六文銭と仕事する機会が多く、頻繁に顔を合わせるようになったそうです。
四角さんを狙っていた吉田さんは、仕事の用もなしにわざわざ六文銭の練習場に顔を出しては四角さんに話しかけてアピールしていたのだとか。
交際に発展したきっかけは酒癖が悪い吉田拓郎さんがケンカで負傷し、そんな彼を四角佳子が介抱したことがきっかけで恋仲になったそうです。
四角佳子さんは深夜営業しているスーパーを探して、ガーゼと絆創膏を購入し、泣きじゃくりながら介抱したといいます。
1年間の交際を経て1972年に結婚し、同年６月に軽井沢の聖パウロ教会で結婚式を挙げました。
結婚した当初、吉田拓郎さんは26歳で四角さんは20歳でした。
新婚生活は東京・高円寺の2DKのアパートでスタートさせましたが、当初から喧嘩ばかりだったそうです。
喧嘩の理由としては、食事の趣味が合わない、嫁はアウトドアだが吉田さんはインドア、亭主関白の吉田さんに対して四角さんも気が強いなど、価値観の全てが真逆だったことが影響していたそうです。
吉田さんは四角と結婚する前から性格が合わないことを知っていたそうですが、それよりも四角さんの女性としての魅力が勝ち、結婚に踏み切ったそうです。
名曲「結婚しようよ」は、最初の嫁の四角さんの為に作ったとされます。
離婚理由は不倫だけじゃない？吉田拓郎の誤認逮捕や音楽の成功で急に大金持ちに・・・ 吉田拓郎さんは最初の結婚生活の内に、次の嫁となる浅田美代子さんと不倫関係にあったと有名で、世間ではそれが離婚理由だと思われています。
しかし、実際には浅田さんとの不倫と離婚は関係なかったそうです。
吉田さんは離婚を発表した１９７５年９月のラジオで、
ぼくは決して女房は嫌いではない。好きな女なんだ。でも、暮らしていくのは耐えられない。
と、離婚を発表する際に、”好きな女”と強調しました。
実は、吉田さんの不倫以外にも、夫婦生活が崩壊する事件は多くありました。</description></item><item><title>'Jersey Shore Cast Jokes JWoww Wanted to Get Away from Roger</title><link>/jersey-shore-cast-jokes-jwoww-wanted-to-get-away-from-roger.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/jersey-shore-cast-jokes-jwoww-wanted-to-get-away-from-roger.html</guid><description>Jenni “JWoww” Farley can definitely take a joke — and fire back!
