<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>If 'Beauty And The Beast' Makes Enough Money, Emma Watson Will Score Up To $15 Million</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>If <a href=#>Emma Watson </a>seems a little bit distracted this weekend, it's because she's got some real financial incentive to pay close attention to Beauty and the Beast&nbsp;box office grosses. She earned $3 million upfront to play Belle in the live-action remake of the Disney animated classic, but according to a recent report in The Hollywood Reporter she stands to make an additional five times that much if the movie turns out to be a <a href=#>Maleficent</a>–level hit.</p><p>Maleficent had a worldwide box office gross of $759 million, and Watson's contract reportedly calls for an extra $15 million bonus if Beauty and the Beast pulls in "similar" numbers. It's expected to do so, and analysts have predicted an opening weekend of at least $120 million in North America alone, so maybe Watson won't be nervously checking Box Office Mojo on her phone all weekend after all – it's fun to imagine, though.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-217697 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GettyImages-653266278.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-217697 class=wp-caption-text>Mike Coppola/Getty Images</p><p>According to one anonymous producer quotes in the THR story, Watson was lucky to get such a deal, particularly from a studio that's become notorious for penny-pinching in recent years. If there's another thing Disney is notorious for, it's the fact that they don't really need movie stars in the conventional way to sell a movie to a mass audience, especially when it's based on as beloved a film (or, sorry, a piece of intellectual property) as the original Beauty and the Beast:</p><p>"The IP is the star of the movie," said a producer. "If you hired <a href=# title="Jennifer Lawrence Net Worth">Jennifer Lawrence</a> as Belle, would it really make a difference in the opening [of Beauty and the Beast]? Unlikely."</p><p>For Watson's part, she earned a reported $60 million for her work in the Harry Potter film series, but she's been absent from big budget franchises (and their accompanying huge salaries) since it ended – so her Beauty and the Beast deal can, and more than likely will, signal her return to the sphere of extremely well-compensated stars.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxnCuxJqsrbFdl7Kiv9NmpJqjlah6prrOrp6hZZ2ku6bFjJ6kppldrK61v86nZLChnKF6tK%2FOq5xmaWViuqq4y6Kmp2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./unlimited-games-at-chuck-e-cheese.html><span>←</span><span>How to Get Unlimited Games at Chuck E.
