The 65-year-old rapper took to his wife’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> comment section to defend her against trolls who slammed her for posting a<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> revealing bikini shot</a> on Tuesday, July 4. In the photo, which can be seen <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>here</a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Coco Austin</strong></a>, 44, posed in barely there white bikini bottoms and a cropped red tank that had “Arizona” printed across it on the front. The tiny top allowed for a hefty amount of underboob, and Coco posed facing forward and turned around so people had an up-close-and-personal view of her curvy figure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ice-T-coco-String-Bikini-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>After Ice-T noticed some internet trolls being super rude to the model — with one telling her to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“get over”</a> herself and several others shaming her for showing so much skin <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>as a mom</a> — he immediately took action. “If you have a Problem with Coco… Why do you still Follow her???” he commented. “Weirdo s***…” Coco has not addressed the hate, but she likely appreciates her husband’s unwavering support!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>As fans may recall, this is not the first time the “Colors” hitmaker has taken to the internet to clap back against Coco’s haters. In February,<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Ice-T responded to a critic</a> who described Coco’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2023 Grammys dress</a> as “three sizes too small”. He responded, “When was that last time you had some D***.. That’s the problem. Lol.” He then returned the favor and insulted the Twitter user who came out against Coco and sarcastically called her “Hot as F….”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8 data-skm-boomerang-el-9=processed>In May 2022, Ice-T hit back at CNN for sharing an article about his and Coco’s decision to push their then 6-year-old daugher, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Chanel</strong></a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;in a stroller</a> while&nbsp;vacationing in The Bahamas. “Lol… CNN? Really?” he <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweeted</a>. “MFs ain’t got s*** else to talk about. F em all. Smh. Lol.” Coco also took to Twitter to address the backlash. “This stroller thing trending right now about me using a stroller to push Chanel around is ridiculous! Isnt there a war &<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> mass shootings going</a> as we speak & you’d rather mess with my mothering? SMH,” she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>slammed</a>.</p><p data-skm-boomerang-el-9=processed>The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Law & Order&nbsp;actor</a> and Coco also got questioned in 2022 when the latter shared a video of herself giving her daughter<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> a bath in the kitchen sink</a> and when they revealed in 2020 that at 4 years old, Chanel was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>occasionally breastfed</a>. “At a time when the world feels like its coming to an end.. suck up as much love as you can!” Coco wrote in an<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Instagram pic</a> that showed Chanel feeding from her nipple. “I know the moms out there will appreciate this pic! Ive been getting alot [sic] of props in the breasfeeding [sic] community and get tons of emails from woman/moms appreciating me bringing light to the subject .. I write a baby blog about my journey with Chanel and soon I will write about what it’s like to continue boob time with a 4 year old.” In 2021, Coco called the time with her daughter <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“a big bonding moment.”</a></p><p data-skm-boomerang-el-9=processed>Coco and Ice-T clearly don’t let the haters get to them and are going to do as they please!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e49uZqKblWLBbrDEn5ynnKNisLCvzmaYrquknrtuwMinsGarpKe2r7OMm6CkoZ6efA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./do-you-warm-up-smoked-salmon-2.html><span>←</span><span>Do you warm up smoked salmon?</span></a>
