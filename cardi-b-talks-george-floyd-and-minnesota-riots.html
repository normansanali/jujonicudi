"Too much peaceful marches, too much trending hashtags and NO SOLUTIONS! The people are left with NO CHOICE."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Cardi further explained her thoughts regarding the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a32701730/how-to-help-george-floyd-donate/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="recent killing of George Floyd" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">recent killing of George Floyd</a>, why people resort to rioting, and the vital importance of voting with a two-minute-long clip which she shared to Twitter.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Seeing people looting and going extremely outraged, it makes me feel like, 'Yes! Finally! Finally motherfuckers is gonna hear us now. Yeah!' And as much as people is so against it, at this point I feel like I'm not against it," explained Cardi. "It's really frustrating ... police brutality been going on even way before I was born. I feel like I have done videos against police brutality, I feel like this is like my seventh time. I feel I've been doing police brutality videos ever since my teeth been fucked up. And the only shit that changed has been my fucking teeth."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The rapper reiterated that though she wishes people didn't have to resort to violence, she completely understands why protesters feel the need to enforce more extreme measures to ensure their voices are heard.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Let's say since Instagram started, how many peaceful protests have we seen? How many trending hashtags have we seen? These hashtags keep freaking repeating themselves," explained Cardi. "[Rioting] is now what people have to resort to."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Cardi doesn't believe that rioting is the only answer to solving the problem of race relations in America, however. According to the rapper, the only true solution is for people to vote against the politicians who continue to ignore the repeating tragedies against Black people in America.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Another way for the people to take power—I don't want to make everything political but it is what it is—it's by voting," she declared.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"And when I say voting I'm not only talking about the president," said Cardi, who has been a vocal supporter of former Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders. "We could vote for mayors, we could vote for judges and we could also vote for D.A.s [district attorneys]. These people have the power—these D.A.s, these judges, these attorneys—they have the power to prosecute."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Want to follow Cardi's advice?
