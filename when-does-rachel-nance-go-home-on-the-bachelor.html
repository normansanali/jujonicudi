Because of this, it is safe to say that she and Joey have quite the connection, leaving viewers with just one burning question: Where will she finish on the beloved competition series?</p><p data-characters=74 data-current-count=74 data-injectable=false>Fortunately, we got you covered.

While it is unclear what happens between Rachel and Joey on said date, she is reportedly sent home at the rose ceremony afterwards, ultimately failing to secure her spot in the final two.</p><p data-characters=192 data-current-count=192 data-injectable=false>As fans of The Bachelor franchise might know, it is not uncommon for the third place finisher to become the next Bachelorette.
