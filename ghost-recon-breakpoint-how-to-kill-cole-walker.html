You’re not alone. This tough-as-nails antagonist has proven to be a source of frustration for many players, but that hasn’t stopped them from trying to take him down early.</p><p>The leader of the Wolves private military group is much more powerful than any enemy you’ll face in the game, and you’ll need to utilize a few tips and tricks if you want to defeat him and finish the campaign.</p><h3>See more</h3><h2>How to kill Cole Walker in Ghost Recon Breakpoint</h2><h3>Step 1: Stealthily eliminate surrounding enemies</h3><p>As you approach the bridge that leads to the base in the final mission, take out your drone and start marking enemies. You’ll see a few standard grunts across the bridge, some heavy units with mini-guns, and most importantly, an alarm-sounder standing next to a small building at the end of the bridge.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64><p>Use a sniper rifle to eliminate the first few soldiers, then take out the alarm-sounder with another shot. Once you do this, there is a good chance the heavy enemies nearby will be alerted, but you can still eliminate them before the rest of their friends know what is going on.</p><p>Next, pull out your drone again and keep marking targets. You’ll see a few more heavy units, and a watchtower close to your location, which is home to a heavy unit wielding a rocket launcher. Send your drone out into the center of the base and you’ll also see a Behemoth tank. Do everything in your power to take out enemies quietly without the tank seeing you because, if it does, you’re going to have to take it out in the next step.</p><h3>Step 2: Take down the Behemoth</h3><p>You can skip killing most of the enemies on the base if you want to go straight to killing Cole Walker, but the Behemoth tank must be eliminated before doing so.</p><p>The most dangerous type of drone in Ghost Recon Breakpoint, the Behemoth can fire devastating machine guns up close and its mortars can hit you from nearly anywhere on the base. Your best bet for eliminating it quickly is to first use any available rocket rounds and aim for its glowing red spots, as these take more damage than the rest of the Behemoth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Once you’ve fired your rockets, remove the silencer on your primary weapon and begin firing at the weak spots from behind cover. You will need to move every few seconds when a red glowing area appears around you, however, as this means you’re in a mortar round’s area of effect. If you are hit by this, you will die. After doing this for a minute or two, you should be able to destroy Behemoth, and you can enter the building Walker is hiding in.</p><h3>Step 3: Set a trap for Walker</h3><p>It might be a little anticlimactic, but we found this strategy to be, by far, the easiest way to eliminate Walker if you’re playing the final mission alone. Enter the doorway into the large room housing Walker and his Wolves, and immediately turn left toward the staircase. Put down several mines on the floor just in front of the staircase and sprint to the top.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Aim your weapon with the highest magazine size at the bottom of the staircase and wait for the Wolves to start chasing after you. Your goal is to kill all of them before they hit the mines, so Walker is the one who steps on them. It will likely take you a few tries to get the aiming and timing down, but a light machine gun can easily take out the pack before Walker turns the corner.</p><p>Once Walker arrives, start lighting him up with your weapon and back up so he is forced to start walking toward you. Don’t worry about the drones flanking him, as they will be destroyed when he hits the mines.</p><h3>Step 4: Kill any remaining enemies</h3><p>There is a chance that you won’t be able to progress in the mission after killing Walker. In this case, go to the mission in your menu and select the “retry” option. You won’t have to kill Walker again, but you will need to eliminate all the other Wolves in the room before you can proceed with the next part of the mission.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The same steps can solve some other bugs, too, such as your character being unable to move, but if you encounter a situation where you can’t use your item wheel or drone properly, you’ll need to restart the game from your dashboard. If you ever choose to play the final mission again, Walker won’t be there, but you can still destroy the Behemoth, eliminate his men, and complete the mission.</p><h2>How to kill Walker at the beginning of Ghost Recon Breakpoint</h2><p><span>Players have encountered other ways to kill Walker if you want to skip most of the campaign. When you begin playing, your first mission will be to eliminate Walker, but it recommends a gear score of at least 150. There’s a way to bypass that condition as well, by tailing Walker’s officers down to the Howard Airfield. This is where Walker is during the standard route’s final mission, so you’re skipping all of that gameplay to find him.</span></p><p><span>If you want to disregard the game’s suggestions from the start, you can kill Walker during your first mission. There will be three helicopters you have to inspect, but ignore the second on your journey and go for the third to unlock the Erewhon hub area. </span><a href=#><span>Gmoney Mozart shows in his video,</span></a><span>&nbsp; on youtube that you can purchase a grenade launcher en route to the second helicopter for immediate use before you come to inspect it. Shoot a few rounds of grenades at the aircraft, and you’ll kill Walker right away.</span></p><p><span>Co-op isn’t mandatory for this mission. We defeated Walker on our own, but the final </span><i><span>Ghost Recon Breakpoint </span></i><span>campaign mission will be drastically easier if you play with at least one other person. Not only will this person be able to deal extra damage against enemies, but they’ll also draw fire away from you so that you can focus on dealing with Walker. We recommend teaming up with a friend to take on the costly endeavor of facing Walker because going at it alone will leave you devoid of all your health.</span></p><h4 class="b-editors-recs-title h-editors-recs-title">Editors' Recommendations</h4><span id=publisher-md itemprop=publisher itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/Organization><span itemprop=url itemtype=https://schema.org/Url content="https://www.digitaltrends.com"><span itemprop=logo itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXGoquapKSnsq%2Bw0meaqKVfnK6utc2gZqCgn6jBbr7EnKanZZKnsqK3z6igp6xdnby4edOoZKShnKF6pLvLnmSwmZygsrN7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./everything-you-need-to-know-about-ken-jeongs-daughter-zooey-jeong.html><span>←</span><span>Everything You Need To Know About Ken Jeongs Daughter, Zooey Jeong</span></a>
