In her video (which has since been deleted, but lives on&nbsp;<a href=#>via Twitter</a>), Wilson recommends that Dyer inject some filler in her chin, as well as utilize a procedure to "slim the face."&nbsp;</p><p>When Wilson's post was hit with backlash after angering Dyer's fans, she shared an entirely different video —&nbsp;in which she apologized for the previous one. "I did not mean to offend anyone, including Natalia," Wilson said, insisting in the caption, "Her photo was simply an example." Though Wilson had hoped to "clear the air," her apology video seemed to miss the point, as she said, "I was simply just offering suggestions, not on what you have to do, just on what the possibilities are."&nbsp;</p><p>Dyer, as one might expect, chose not to wade into the controversy whatsoever, and has not commented publicly on the brouhaha.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcm5kZ4B5e9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5zZqrmqSZlnqlxcSrZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-plus-size-tights.html><span>←</span><span>The Best Plus Size Tights That Are So Flattering: Starting at Just $10</span></a>
