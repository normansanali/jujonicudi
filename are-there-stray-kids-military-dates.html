No, I’m not talking about the downright ridiculous standards and how damaging they are. What I mean is – at some point or another, we all have to temporarily say goodbye to our favorite boy groups when they’re called up for mandatory military service. Sadly, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stray Kids</a></strong> inevitably will be a part of the roster.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>Even though we all wish we could just escape this unjust reality, every K-Pop fan has to face it at some point or another. Recently, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ARMY had to go through this moment for the first time</a>, and one day, it will be us STAYS experiencing this inevitable and annoying fate. Well, maybe not annoying, but it is quite cruel to be deprived of our boys, after all.</p><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=591 data-injectable=true>Here’s an upside though: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Stray Kids’ members are still quite young</a>. Bang Chan is the oldest, and he’s pretty much exempt from military service. So, do we know how long we have before the rest of the members enlist?</p><h2 id=h-when-are-the-stray-kids-going-to-the-military data-injectable=false>When are the Stray Kids going to the military?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Stray-Kids.jpg><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=632 data-injectable=true>At the time of writing, there is still no exact date confirmed for Stray Kids’ enlistment. However, there is a lot of speculation regarding the possible enlistment dates, primarily based on their ages. Between the ages of 18 and 28, all South Korean men must attend mandatory conscription – <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with some exceptions to the rule</a>.</p><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=317 data-injectable=false>This means that each member will be forced to enlist before reaching the age of 28. As mentioned previously, the oldest member is Bangchan; however, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he is exempt from enlisting due to having dual citizenship</a> – Korean and Australian. Lee Know and Changbin are both 24, meaning that they should have enlisted by 2028.</p><p data-characters=428 data-current-count=745 data-injectable=true>Hyunjin, Han Jisung, Felix, and Seungmin were all born in 2000, meaning that they will have to enlist by 2029. Meanwhile, the maknae of the group I.N, will only be forced to enter military grounds in 2030. However, don’t be fooled by the years we still have left. While they won’t have to enlist until 2028, the members may choose to attend the service before reaching 28 years old – either together or separately.</p><h2 id=h-will-stray-kids-come-back-after-the-military data-injectable=false>Will Stray Kids come back after the military?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=218 data-current-count=518 data-injectable=true>As of now, it is unclear whether or not Stray Kids will come back after the military. Given the huge fan base they have, however, it is likely that they will return in some shape or form after serving in the military.</p><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=291 data-injectable=false>In the meantime, neither JYP Entertainment nor the members have hinted at a potential enlistment announcement in the near future. So all STAYS can rest assured in knowing we still have some time with the boys, especially with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">all the rumors regarding a possible world tour</a> sometime in 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46aqZ5lpJ2ys7GMrKurmaliuKqw0makoqSZqa6zxYydmK2do2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amd-trinity-review-a10-4600m-a-new-hope.html><span>←</span><span>AMD Trinity Gaming Performance - The AMD Trinity Review (A10-4600M): A New Hope</span></a>
