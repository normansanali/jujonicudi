The streaming service is currently releasing the show’s third season, with more episodes set to air in early November. The previous two seasons were very popular with fans, and viewers loved watching the cast find love. The concept of the show centers around single men and women falling in love and getting engaged without ever seeing one another. The engaged couples then take a honeymoon and try to make their relationships work in the real world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One woman trying to find love in this season of Love Is Blind is Raven Ross. On the show, she is engaged to SK in season 3, but fans do not know if they will get married in the final episode. Let’s get into who Raven Ross is and why she chose to join Netflix’s Love Is Blind.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly: Everything Love Is Blind Contestants Have Said About The Show</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-raven-ross><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Who Is Raven Ross?</span></h2><p>Raven Ross is among the newest cast members of Netflix’s dating show Love Is Blind. She is featured in season 3 of the highly successful show. While in the pods, Ross had multiple connections before she finally got engaged to SK Alagbada. Considering so few couples have stayed together, fans do not have high hopes for Ross and Alagbada.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ross is from New Orleans, Louisiana. During her time on the show, she addressed what it was like for her to grow up as an African-American in the white culture of the South. Ross also made note that her childhood best friends are from Nigeria. Ross now lives in Dallas, Texas.</p><h2 id=who-did-raven-ross-date-before-love-is-blind><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Who Did Raven Ross Date Before Love Is Blind?</span></h2><p>Raven Ross has been very candid about her bad relationship habits. She claims to have a history of moving too quickly into a relationship without giving herself the opportunity to get to know the guy properly. Ross also admits to being with men who she is not that interested in because they are interested in her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Previously, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ross was in a very serious relationship with an older man</a> in Dallas, Texas. Apparently, the ex-boyfriend was also quite wealthy. It is unknown how large the age-gap was. Ross called things off with the older boyfriend.</p><h2 id=raven-ross-is-a-pilates-instructor-and-bartender><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Raven Ross Is A Pilates Instructor And Bartender</span></h2><p>Exercise is Raven Ross’s great love in life. She has a huge passion for fitness, which caused her to go into the field professionally. <a href=#>Ross is a certified Pilates instructor</a> for classic Pilates as well as a Pilates master trainer at Club Pilates. Additionally, the Netflix reality star is a Barre instructor and a Trigger Point Foam Rolling specialist. She has a YouTube channel to post workout routines for fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While fitness is her dream, Ross also works weekends as a bartender to help make ends meet. She seemed rather embarrassed by the side hustle when she told fellow Love Is Blind contestant Bartise Bowden in the pods.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Love Is Blind’s Deepti And Kyle Became A Real-Life Couple</a></span></p><h2 id=raven-ross-had-a-connection-with-bartise-bowden><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Raven Ross Had A Connection With Bartise Bowden</span></h2><p>While in the pods, where she could not see any of the men she was dating, Raven Ross initially had a connection with fellow contestant Bartise Bowden. They seemed to hit it off and had great chemistry, but that all changed as Ross began to appear distant and uninterested.</p><p>Fans were particularly annoyed with Ross when she was seen doing jumping jacks while Bowden was sharing the heartbreaking tale of his parents’ divorce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-bartise-break-up-with-raven><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Why Did Bartise Break Up With Raven?</span></h2><p>The jumping jack scandal seemed to ruin Raven Ross’s connection with Bartise Bowden. He sensed a lack of sensitivity from Ross and said he wanted to end their relationship. Ross claimed she also did not want to continue their relationship.</p><p>Both Bowden and Ross moved on to be engaged to other contestants, but that did not stop them from reconnecting in-person. When they finally saw each other, Bowden was impressed with Ross’s appearance. Fans wonder if the two will rekindle their relationship, especially with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bowden regretting not giving Ross enough attention</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fans-find-raven-ross-annoying-on-love-is-blind><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Fans Find Raven Ross Annoying On Love Is Blind</span></h2><p>There does not seem to be a fan of Love Is Blind that likes Raven Ross. Viewers find her self-centered and very annoying. Fans of the show also extremely dislike how rude she seems to be to other people, specifically when they are sharing something personal.</p><p>The two largest incidents that caused fans to dislike Ross involved Bartise Bowden. As previously mentioned, Ross was working out while Bowden was sharing the painful event of his parents’ divorce. If that was not insensitive enough, Ross was seen eating nachos while Bowden broke things off with her.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Cast Of Love Is Blind Season One: Who Has The Highest Net Worth Today?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sk-alagbada-proposed-to-raven-ross><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>SK Alagbada Proposed To Raven Ross</span></h2><p>Despite having so many issues with her connection with Bartise Bowden, Raven Ross did get a ring out of the pods. After moving on from Bowden, Ross began to have a connection with SK Alagbada. He joined the pods to find monogamous love, as his family is traditionally polygamous.</p><p>Alagbada and Ross are currently engaged on the show, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans question whether or not the two of them will get a happy ending</a>. They both claim to be on the show for the right reasons, but fans will have to wait until the end of the season to see how their relationship turns out.</p><h2 id=why-did-raven-ross-join-love-is-blind><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Why Did Raven Ross Join Love Is Blind?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like any other contestant on Netflix’s hit show Love Is Blind, Raven Ross says that she is on the show to find her true love match. However, <a href=#>fans have long suspected that many contestants on the show are not there for the right reasons</a>.</p><p>There is always the possibility that Ross is actually on the show to boost her fame. Her Instagram and YouTube channel have been doing very well since the show began airing, which is not a coincidence. Fans hope that SK Alagbada does not get his heart broken by Ross if she is only on the show to gain popularity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdp663sc1mqairo2K3sLXNnptmppWps62116xkpaemmnqqv4ybo6KmlGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-lindsey-sine-nikola-peter-foley-accuser-amid-sexual-assault-allegations-259317-html.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Lindsey Sine Nikola?
