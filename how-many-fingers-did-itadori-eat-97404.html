Celebrity</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>7th – 16th Fingers where Jogo feeds Itadori all 10 Fingers of Sukuna in Chapter 111 Shibuya Incident 29 to Chapter 112 Shibuya Incident 30 So in total he ate 16 fingers</p><p>7th – 16th Fingers where Jogo feeds Itadori all 10 Fingers of Sukuna in Chapter 111 Shibuya Incident 29 to Chapter 112 Shibuya Incident 30 No, the girls in Chapter 111 Shibuya Incident 29 only gave Yuji 1 finger. Concluding to 15 fingers so far. The manga has also said that, I think.</p><p>4th Finger from Ep. 24 where Fushiguro hands over the finger to Itadori and Sukuna eats it. 5th and 6th Fingers from the two girls in Chapter 111 Shibuya Incident 29</p><p>After swallowing Sukuna’s finger, Yuji was taken to the Tokyo Metropolitan Magic Technical College in order to be exorcised, meaning that both he and Sukuna would die in the process.</p><h2>How many fingers did Yuji eat?</h2><p>If you haven’t been par with the latest incident in the manga, before Sukuna was awoken in the Shibuya arc, Jogo mentioned that Yuji has consumed<strong> 15</strong> fingers, but I believe that Itadori has consumed maybe more and close to 20 fingers already. In the first 2 episodes, we know that Yuji has at least consumed 2 because 1. he ate one himself and 2.</p><p>The other assumption was under the bridge when Megumi defeated that special curse who also held onto one of<strong> Sukuna </strong>‘s finger. When Megumi handed it to Yuji,<strong> Sukuna</strong> deliberately ate it when his mouth appeared on Yuji’s palm. That is finger #4.</p><h2>What does it mean when Sukuna eats his finger?</h2><p>It also means that<strong> there are potentially other abilities that have yet to be awakened as a result of consum </strong>ing<strong> Sukuna’s</strong> finger. The more fingers he consumes, the more possibilities there are for new powers and abilities to emerge. However, that does increase the possibility of Sukuna gaining control over Yuji’s body.</p><p>Eating that rotting finger not only made Yuji a host for Sukuna in Jujutsu Kaisen, it also<strong> gave him a host for helpful abilities as well.</strong> WARNING: The following contains minor spoilers for the Jujutsu Kaisen manga. Having swallowed the rotting finger of Sukuna, Jujutsu Kaisen’ s Yuji Itadori became a host for the King of Curses.</p><p>After swallowing Sukuna’s finger, Yuji was taken to the Tokyo Metropolitan Magic Technical College in order<strong> to be exorcised, meaning that both he and Sukuna would die in the process.</strong></p><p>He can use these abilities up to<strong> four times</strong> before getting too worn out. With his Divergent Punch technique, Yuji punches a target, then uses his Cursed Energy to create a second impact, though he has since stopped using it due to the Kyoto third-years critiquing this attack.</p><p><strong>Because he’s a host to a Special Curse,</strong> Yuji is resistant to all kinds of poison. However, he is still susceptible to the pain that the poisons cause. This was first seen in his fight against Junpei where he proved to be immune to the Moon Dregs’ poison.</p><p>Yuji has great control over his body, as he is able to<strong> stop his punch just before making an impact </strong>, and<strong> he’s able to adjust the power in his fist.</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Y<strong>uji Is A Fast Learner. It’s</strong> said<strong> that the signs of a great learner are asking questions, dedication, patience, and being a hard worker. This is</strong> especially true in Yuji’s case. He constantly asks his instructor questions to get a better understanding of what’s going on around him and how to use his new curse power.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2b6%2FEpZybqpmpxm%2ByzGifqK9doq6vxYyfoKeflafAbrDInWSirJGZvLO1jJ6YrWVpbIFxgI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-do-i-run-a-cash-disbursements-journal-in-quickbooks-html.html><span>←</span><span>How do i run a cash disbursements journal in quickbooks ?</span></a>
