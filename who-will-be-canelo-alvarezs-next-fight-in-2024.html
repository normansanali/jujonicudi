Let's delve into the potential opponents for Canelo Alvarez's upcoming fight and analyze who he might face in 2024.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Canelo's Dominance and Return to Form<span data-mce-fragment=1>&nbsp;</span></h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Canelo Alvarez made a triumphant return to the ring following his dominant win over Jermell Charlo in September. After a shock defeat to Dmitry Bivol at light-heavyweight last year, Canelo reassured his fans about his form and skills with a resounding victory over Charlo. He dropped Charlo in round seven on his way to a unanimous decision victory in Las Vegas, reclaiming his undisputed pound-for-pound king status.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Potential Opponents for Canelo Alvarez</h2><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Jermall Charlo<span data-mce-fragment=1>&nbsp;</span></h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>As it currently stands, the most likely opponent for Canelo in his next fight is Jermall Charlo. Sources have indicated that a deal for Canelo to face Charlo, the twin brother of his last opponent, is in the works. In an interview with TV Azteca, Canelo hinted that his next opponent would be American, making it increasingly likely that Jermall Charlo will be the man to take on the Mexican superstar.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>David Benavidez<span data-mce-fragment=1>&nbsp;</span></h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>Initially seen as a strong contender for Canelo's next fight, David Benavidez is no longer the most likely opponent. Despite publicly calling out Canelo for the battle of undisputed status at 168 pounds, it seems that Canelo has selected a different opponent. However, should that fall through, Benavidez will be waiting due to his links with Al-Haymon's PBC, with whom Canelo has a three-fight deal.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Terence Crawford<span data-mce-fragment=1>&nbsp;</span></h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>Another potential opponent for Canelo is Terence Crawford. After Canelo's victory over Charlo, Crawford expressed his eagerness to face the Mexican superstar, proclaiming that "Canelo vs Crawford is the biggest fight in boxing." However, Canelo appeared to cool talk of a potential fight with Crawford, stating that it "doesn't make sense" at the moment. Despite this, given Crawford's American background and his links with PBC, a secret deal between the two legends is not entirely implausible.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Recent Developments and Speculations</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Recent reports have indicated that Canelo Alvarez's next fight is scheduled for May 4, 2024, on Cinco De Mayo weekend. While his opponent is yet to be confirmed, there have been strong indications pointing towards a potential showdown with Jaime Munguia. The young star Jaime Munguia is considered among the best at super middleweight and is seen as a talented fighter who could pose a challenge to Canelo. This fight would also mark a unique occasion as it would be one of the rare times when Canelo faces a fellow Mexican fighter, adding an intriguing dynamic to the matchup.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Additionally, reports suggest that Canelo's departure from Premier Boxing Champions (PBC) after a one-fight deal has significantly altered the potential opponent pool for his next fight. Despite the pressure from fans for blockbuster fights against David Benavidez or Terence Crawford, it seems that Canelo is leaning towards facing Jaime Munguia, who is co-promoted by Golden Boy and Zanfer Promotions and fights on DAZN.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Analysis and Predictions</h2><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Jermall Charlo</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>Given the existing talks and the lineage of facing Charlo's twin brother, Jermell Charlo, it seems highly likely that Jermall Charlo could be Canelo's next opponent. The potential matchup promises to be a thrilling showdown, with both fighters possessing exceptional skills and tenacity in the ring.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Jaime Munguia</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>The prospect of facing Jaime Munguia presents an interesting challenge for Canelo. Munguia's recent wins and his status as a rising star in the super middleweight division make him a formidable opponent. Should this fight come to fruition, it would serve as a litmus test of Canelo's current form and his ability to maintain his dominance in the sport.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>David Benavidez and Terence Crawford</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>While David Benavidez and Terence Crawford are not the front-runners at the moment, their potential involvement cannot be ruled out entirely. Should the negotiations with Jermall Charlo or Jaime Munguia encounter obstacles, the possibility of Canelo facing Benavidez or Crawford remains on the horizon.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Canelo Alvarez's next fight in 2024 holds significant intrigue and anticipation within the boxing community. The potential matchups with Jermall Charlo, Jaime Munguia, David Benavidez, or Terence Crawford offer a diverse range of possibilities, each with its own unique narrative and implications for Canelo's illustrious career. As the anticipation builds for the official announcement of his next opponent, the boxing world eagerly awaits another electrifying performance from the Mexican boxing legend.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0miZqLCZo7Rww8eoZLChnKF6o7GMnJinnZykeqK41ZqpnrKjYrumxNNmnaKfmKl6qrqMa2drbA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./victoria-medeiros.html><span>←</span><span>Victoria Medeiros- Net Worth, Bio, Age, Boyfriend, Height, Ethnicity</span></a>
