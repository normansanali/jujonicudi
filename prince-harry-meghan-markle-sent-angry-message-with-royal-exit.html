Earlier this month, the pair revealed that they are <a href=#>expecting their second child together</a> after the former actress suffered a miscarriage in July. As they prepare to transition out of the royal spotlight, <a href=#>the twosome are “relieved”</a> to be starting their new chapter.</p><p>“Harry and Meghan finally feel free,” a source previously told Us. “They have so much to look forward to.”</p><p>A separate insider noted that the queen, 94, <a href=#>was holding out hope</a> that her grandson and his wife would change their minds about their exit. Fitzwilliams, however, doesn’t think that the pair “have any second thoughts” about stepping down.</p><p>“The queen has made it absolutely clear that they would always be welcome back if they had a change of heart. I don’t think anybody sees any chance of it [happening],” he told Us. “If it happened, I think the royal family would be delighted.”</p><p>Next month, Harry and the Los Angeles native are set to <a href=#>give their first televised sit-down interview</a> addressing their rocky path with the royal family. The move came as a shock to <a href=#><strong>Prince William</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Duchess Kate</strong></a>, who’ve had a tense relationship with the Sussexes over the years.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“At the moment, relations between the brothers are very, very distant,” Fitzwilliams said, predicting that Harry and Meghan will “be pretty icy” about the Cambridges during their tell-all.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p><strong>Is Prince Harry refusing to mend relationships with the Royal Family?
