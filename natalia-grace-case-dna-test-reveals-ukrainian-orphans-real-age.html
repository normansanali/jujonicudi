In the newly released ID docuseries, The Curious Case of Natalia Grace: Natalia Speaks, the Ukrainian orphan—who was adopted by Michael and Kristine Barnett in 2010—detailed her experience with the Barnetts and the subsequent aftermath of her adoption.
Though the former couple alleged that Natalia—who has spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, a rare genetic disorder—was not a young girl at the time of her adoption, but rather an adult with dangerous tendencies, Natalia has long maintained that she was truly a child when she began living with the Barnetts."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
