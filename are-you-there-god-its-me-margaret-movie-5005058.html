She notably played Cassie Lang in the first two&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ant-Man</a>&nbsp;films.&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rachel McAdams</a>&nbsp;</strong>and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Benny Safdie</strong></a> star as Margaret’s parents, Barbara (who is Christian) and Herb (who is Jewish).&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kathy Bates</a>&nbsp;</strong>stars as Margaret’s grandmother, Sylvia. Other cast members include <strong>Gary Houston</strong>,<strong> Mila Dillon</strong>,<strong> Elle Graham</strong>,<strong> Amari Alexis Price</strong>, and <strong>Katherine Kupferer</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Rachel McAdams spoke to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Hollywood Reporter </a>about what drew her to playing Barbara.&nbsp;“I felt like Kelly [Fremon Craig, the director] drew a mother that was on a parallel journey with her daughter and trying to be a mom, but also be a person,” the Mean Girls&nbsp;star said. “[She] is a very supportive mother but also wants to give her child a sense of independence and autonomy and let her go through the wonders of life herself and not cloud those too much with her own ideas of how you should and should not be.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Are-You-There-God-Updates-embed-3.jpg><h3>Crew</h3><p id=content-paragraph-12>Kelly Fremon Craig is the director and screenwriter of the film. She’s also a producer with others including Judy and James L. Brooks, who she previously worked with on the 2016 film&nbsp;The Edge of Seventeen. Other producers include <strong>Richard Sakai</strong>, <strong>Amy Brooks</strong>, and <strong>Julie Ansel</strong>. The crew is also made up of editors <strong>Oona Flaherty</strong> and <strong>Nick Moore</strong>, cinematographer <strong>Tom Ives</strong>, and music composer <strong>Hans Zimmer</strong>. Gracie Films produced the movie and Lionsgate is the distributor.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>In an interview with<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;<i>Entertainment Weekly</i></a>, Kelly reflected on when Judy agreed to surrender the rights to her book so a movie could be made. “She was very nervous that someone would turn the film into something very glossy and pretty, where all the edges were sanded off,” Kelly shared. “When I sat down with her, she had just seen my first film, The Edge of Seventeen, and she expressed that that made her feel confident that I was going to embrace all the flaws and nuances. That gave her confidence that the film would have the same honesty that she is so known for.”</p><h2>How Close Will the Film Be to the Novel?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>Kelly explained to&nbsp;EW&nbsp;why she kept the movie in the same era with the same story as Judy’s novel.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>“While certain details have changed over the years, the experience of growing up is really universal,” she said. “It’s the same across the decades. There’s something about an 11-year-old or 12-year-old girl today, watching a girl in 1970 go through the exact same experience that she’s going through today. It feels so comforting to know that you’re part of a long lineage. It takes that ‘you’re not alone’ feeling and multiplies it exponentially. Because everyone every year before you has gone through this, and [they will] every year after.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Rachel McAdams told&nbsp;THR that she has high hopes for the lessons that this movie can teach. “I hope there’s, above all, a feeling of togetherness and community and feeling, as women, like we’re all on the same team,” she explained. “That there’s nothing you can’t talk about with each other.&nbsp;And for men, too.” Rachel also said, “Movies are such a great way to get the ball rolling at the dinner table. I hope that it fosters conversation and a feeling of not being alone.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8CrnGaxn6p6tbTEq5xmn5%2BZeqrA0maknmWdlr%2BordGeq2aln6u2pnmUaWduaGVtfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tatjana-asla.html><span>←</span><span>Tatjana Asla -Bio, Age, Net Worth, Career, Nationality, Height, Facts</span></a>
