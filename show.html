They won't. Our plan is to only make the Slot A TBird part available to our OEM partners who have requested a Slot A TBird part and plan on using it in their current systems featuring the AMD-750 chipset."</span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span>The idea of a Socket-A to Slot-A converter (à la the current Socket-370 to Slot-1 converters) has come up more than once over here, and we decided to ask AMD about it.&nbsp; Officially, AMD is neither endorsing nor supporting such a converter card although they wouldn't deny that it could be done.&nbsp; The only reason Intel is supporting a Socket-370 to Slot-1 converter is to ease the transition to FC-PGA 370, but we have already established that AMD isn't looking to make this a smooth transition to Socket-A at all.&nbsp; We may see Socket-A to Slot-A converter cards in the future, but it is very clear that AMD wants to make this move to Socket-A as quickly as possible, allowing no time for any transitional tools such as a converter card.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span>The assumption has always been that, upon the release of the Thunderbird, everyone would be running motherboard platforms with DDR SDRAM support, but unfortunately, that won't be the case.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span>Remember that we just said that the only two available platforms for Socket-A processors at the launch of the Duron/Thunderbird will be the AMD 750 and the VIA KZ133.&nbsp; We already know that the AMD 750 doesn't support DDR SDRAM, and as we made it a point to mention twice above, <b><i>the KZ133 is nothing more than the KX133 with support for Socket-A</i></b>.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span>This translates into no DDR SDRAM platforms available for the Athlon at the launch of the Thunderbird – don't kill the messenger.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span>It won't be until the release of the Mustang in Q3/Q4 that we will see the introduction of the AMD 760 chipset with DDR SDRAM support, but at the same time, we should see the AMD 760MP (also known as the AMD 770), which will be the first multiprocessor capable Athlon chipset allowing for 2-way Athlon configurations.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span>At some point during that time, ALi and SiS should be releasing their Athlon chipsets, but realistically, don't expect either of those two companies to bring anything to the table that you will want to take over the AMD or VIA chipsets.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIJ1fY5v</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brian-daviss-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html><span>←</span><span>Brian Daviss Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</span></a>
