While a late addition to the Jersey Shore cast, coming in as a replacement for Angelina in season 3, Deena quickly fit in with everyone in the house upon her arrival. A long-time friend of Snooki’s, the pair called themselves “meatballs” – a nickname for short, curvy, “spicy” Italian ladies.</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=235 data-injectable=false>Deena has also appeared on other MTV shows, such as Couples Therapy, When I Was 17, and Silent Library, as well as other shows like Celebrity Fear Factor.

Initially, Ronnie got paid $80,000 per episode for Jersey Shore, but that figure increased to $150,000 after he played a part in increasing the show’s drama with the ever-looming possibility of fights and scandals.</p><p data-characters=531 data-current-count=924 data-injectable=true>In 2017, Ortiz-Magro purchased a Las Vegas property for $725,000. Unfortunately, many domestic disputes took place at the house and the police were called to the scene multiple times. In 2020, he announced that he was selling his home for $870,000. Still, the star has racked up a net worth of approximately <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$3 million</a> – but may be lower in more recent years due to some likely pricey legal fees and time away from Family Vacation after his 2021 arrest. Ronnie has not returned as a full-time cast member since his departure.</p><h2 id=angelina-pivarnick-has-a-net-worth-of-4-million data-injectable=false>Angelina Pivarnick – $4 million</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Getty-Images-Angelina-Pivarnick.jpg><p data-characters=521 data-current-count=821 data-injectable=true>In Season 1 of Jersey Shore, Angelina&nbsp;Pivarnick <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly</a>&nbsp;made $3,000 per episode, but in Season 2, her earnings increased to $15,000 per episode, thanks to the early success of the reality series. That gravy train soon came to a halt, as Angelina declined to return for a third season, as her feuds with every one of her co-stars reached an unbearable point – made clear by her constant fights in virtually every episode. She did, however, return for Family Vacation, on better terms with her castmates.</p><p data-characters=500 data-current-count=500 data-injectable=true>Angelina Pivarnick has a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">net worth of $4 million</a> today, so her departure from Jersey Shore in its prime certainly hasn’t held her back. As well as working for the emergency services as a medical technician for ambulances as well as the NY Fire Department, she has appeared on other reality shows, such as the dating series Excused and Couples’ Therapy. Pivarnick has also released songs under the name “Miss AP”, and has her a signature line of false lashes, named Lashelina.</p><h2 id=sammi-sweetheart-giancola-has-a-net-worth-of-4-million data-injectable=false>Sammi “Sweetheart” Giancola – $4 million</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Samantha “Sammi Sweetheart" (@sammisweetheart)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=717 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sammi “Sweetheart” Giancola</a> was an extremely internal part of the original Jersey Shore cast, but she chose not to return for Jersey Shore: Family Vacation until 2023, with her relationship with then-boyfriend Ronnie Ortiz-Magro being one of the show’s most consistent ongoing storylines. Understandably, Giancola wanted to distance herself from revisiting her past relationship on national television.</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=276 data-injectable=false>Since then, Giancola has modeled in several magazines including People and Harper’s Bazaar.
