Number four in the series of movies, the plot follows the terrorization of teenage prom-goers, who, after promptly leaving their event, get caught up with a murderous family, whom they can't escape. Like the movies before, the antagonists were relentless in their horrifying pursuit, and McConaughey's character was very much at the helm.</p><p>Being a part of <a href=#>the Texas Chainsaw Massacre family tree</a>, unfortunately, didn't result in any awards for McConaughey or the movie itself. However, the performer has gone on to win numerous accolades, including an Academy Award for Best Actor in <a href=#>Dallas Buyers Club</a>. <a href=#>Interstellar</a> and <a href=#>The Wolf Of Wall Street</a> are further notable works that have played big parts in McConaughey's career. Along with co-star Ren√©e Zellweger, who portrayed Jenny in the film, McConaughey's stardom helped lead the movie to a wider release (and therefore encouraging a larger audience).</p><h2 id=matthew-mcconaughey-played-vilmer-slaughter>Matthew McConaughey Played Vilmer Slaughter</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/collage-maker-30-jan-2023-02-49-pm.jpg><p>Matthew McConaughey played the role of Vilmer Slaughter in Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation. Every bit as petrifying as any other antagonist in the franchise, Vilmer has no qualms in chasing, hurting and even killing whoever and whenever he pleases. Although he doesn't appear in every part of <a href=#>the Texas Chainsaw Massacre timeline</a>, his character had a big impact and, because of his uncontrollable, evil actions, guides a lot of the narrative. McConaughey memorably displayed Vilmer's ruthless behavior, which sees him claim his first victim almost instantly, followed by a gruesome second killing of another innocent victim.</p><p>The main chase comes in with Jenny (Zellweger). As one of the prom night teenagers who gets caught up in the horror story, she manages to escape the clutches of Vilmer and Leatherface, (although they weren't willing to give up). After one attempt to flee by jumping out a window, Jenny finds herself at a dinner table with Vilmer and his family. Fortunately, she breaks free once again, using Vilmer's cybernetic leg to her advantage. Eventually, Vilmer is killed when a plane flies low enough for the wheel to hit his head, sending Leatherface into a frenzy.</p><h2 id=matthew-mcconaughey-had-a-wild-audition-story-for-texas-chainsaw-massacre>Matthew McConaughey Had A Wild Audition Story For Texas Chainsaw Massacre</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/collage-maker-30-jan-2023-02-55-pm.jpg><p><a href=#>Matthew McConaughey's best ever movies</a> have shown his dedication to each role, and his wild audition story proves his commitment once again. Originally, McConaughey had a smaller role with no lines, that only required one day of shooting (Via <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>.) After the director, Kim Henkel, asked McConaughey if he knew of any actors that would suit the role of Vilmer, he gave a couple of names and left. However, before he drove off, he realized that he could play the part, so went back and suggested himself. Henkel agreed, but there were no actresses around to audition with.</p><p>The production office secretary volunteered herself for the audition and McConaughey found a large spoon to use in place of a weapon. He pinned the secretary against the wall and gave a threatening performance - which was appropriate for the character and helped him get the part. Although <a href=#>Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2022 </a><a href=#>had a new cast</a>, McConaughey still stands out as being an asset to the '90s movie. The actor has an array of films to his name, but there is no question that he was right for his role in <strong>Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation.</strong></p><p><span class=next-single>MORE: <a href=#>Matthew McConaughey's King Of The Hill Role, Explained</a></span></p>Related Topics About The Author<h3 class=section-title>Recommended Articles</h3><a class=dc-img-link href=#><figure></figure></a><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>American Fiction Ending Explained</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Cord Jefferson's American Fiction is nominated for Best Picture.
