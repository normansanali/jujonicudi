Nothing to get jealous about, Calvin! Taylor Swift and Justin Timberlake are really, really huge fans of each other.
The “Shake It Off” singer was presented with her Best Tour gong at the 2016 iHeartRadio Music Awards by the former ‘N Sync hunk on Sunday, April 3. And it was clear from Timberlake’s cute onstage tribute that he’s got a whole lot of respect for Swift.
“I am very happy to be back with all of you in this arena to help honor a great young woman who has accomplished extraordinary things in arenas and stadiums all around our world,” he said.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Edgy And Elegant World Of Mannequin Art</h2><time>Aug 10, 2024</time>

The biggest movie of 2013 is The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. Before the end of the year, the Hunger Games sequel knocked Marvel’s Iron Man 3 out of the top spot with an impressive $418.4 million domestic box office. The film didn’t hit that $1 billion mark as predicted, but you know it will be another big earner for Lionsgate when it hits home video.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>This Is How Much Illinois Basketball Coach Brad Underwood Is Worth</h2><time>Aug 10, 2024</time>

Wednesday is one show that definitely didn’t drop the ball in the casting department. Not only is Jenna Ortega the perfect Wednesday Addams for our times, but Nevermore Academy and the town of Jericho are also filled with top-tier supporting performers, from Gwendoline Christie as Principal Weems to Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzmán as Gomez and Morticia. The best piece of stunt casting in season one, though, has to be the hiring of OG Wednesday herself Christina Ricci.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who Is The Voice NOIVAS Wife, Elissa Henry?
