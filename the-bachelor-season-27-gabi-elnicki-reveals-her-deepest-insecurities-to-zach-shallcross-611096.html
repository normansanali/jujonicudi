Gabi confesses to Zach, "Right now I'm feeling a lot of insecurity." She further says that she had some "feelings" which had been "haunting" her. She elaborates what has been haunting her this week. Gabi says, "So, I was in my head a little bit this week." Zach listens carefully to Gabi, and asks, "Just, cause of time?" Gabi replies, "It's more like, in previous relationships, I was like kind of chosen second. And, so not seeing you for so long, and being the second fantasy suite. I was like I feel very second again," she says.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Did Zach Shallcross slam Gabi Elnicki instead of consoling her?</h2><p>Instead of consoling Gabi, Zach seems to have slammed her by saying, "It's not a mind game, it's literally trying to figure out day by day. Just know it feels right to me." This did not help. She addresses her replies in a confessional. She says, "This is putting it my head. There are other women here. You just get in your own mind." Gabi stands up suddenly and says, 'I'll be right back," and leaves Zach alone. She is seen going into a corner, somewhere behind the trees and crying her heart out. The star says, "I feel very stupid and foolish and why can't I be happy?"</p><p>Will Gabi be eliminated?
