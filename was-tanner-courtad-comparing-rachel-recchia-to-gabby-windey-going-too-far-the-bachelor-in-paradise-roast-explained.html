However, a comment he made during the “Bachelor in Paradise Comedy Roast” might have put a wrench in his plans.</p><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=379 data-injectable=false>“We were all really, really excited when we found out that there was going to be an ex-Bachelorette on the beach, and obviously we were really hoping for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gabby [Windey]</a>, but we got Rachel,” Tanner shared with the crowd (including special guest Katie Thurston, bartender <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wells Adams</a>, and host <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jesse Palmer</a>), naturally garnering a stunned reaction from Rachel herself.</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=644 data-injectable=true>In a confessional to follow, Rachel dished, “I definitely was enjoying this connection I had with Tanner. I opened up to him about things that I haven’t told anyone else, which I think is really special, but why would you say something that mean?”</p><p data-characters=194 data-current-count=194 data-injectable=false>Did Tanner go too far with this roast, ultimately jeopardizing his relationship with Rachel once and for all?

Do you think Tanner’s joke crossed the line?” Naturally, Wells sang like a bird.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 data-characters=175 data-current-count=175 data-injectable=false>Without hesitation, the 39-year-old admitted, “That was the most awkward thing I think I’ve ever been a part of in Paradise,” before diving into the details.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 data-characters=260 data-current-count=435 data-injectable=true>While Wells agrees that Tanner definitely took things too far with his joke, he thinks that the first-ever “Bachelor in Paradise Comedy Roast” was not as bad as it could have been, sharing that “everyone got off easy” for the most part.</p><p data-characters=207 data-current-count=207 data-injectable=false>With Tanner Courtad vulnerable at the forthcoming rose ceremony, did his controversial comment cause him to lose the rose of Rachel Recchia?
