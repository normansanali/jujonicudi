In fact, Chanel and Dom are “working on” becoming America’s “It” couple, they joked. Moreover, the couple agrees that their love languages are “a little bit of touch and words of affirmation.”</p><p></p><p>In celebration of Valentine’s Day, Dom and Chanel gushed over each other via social media. “My Valentine,” the MTV personality captioned an Instagram Story featuring a smiley selfie with Dom. “Baby killed it,” the Los Angeles-based model captioned his own Instagram Story with snippets of the “Vinyl” music video.</p><p>In addition to Chanel’s blossoming romance, her music career continues to thrive! With a new album coming out in “spring/early summer,” fans can expect something different from the “No Plans” artist.</p><p>“The inspiration is what I go into the studio that day feeling. Some days I’m, like, depressed, so we’re writing a sad love song. Some days I’m happy writing a turn-up, it’s going to be a party song. I usually just go into the studio and make a song usually to go with what I’m feeling that day,” Chanel explained. “So, the album is a culmination of all my different emotions over the past two years, which is a lot of emotions.”</p><p>Prior to settling down with Dom, <a href=#>Chanel has mostly kept her love life out of the spotlight</a>. Her most notable public relationship was with Scottish singer<strong>&nbsp;Liam Horne</strong>&nbsp;from April 2014 to July 2017. She was also romantically linked to rapper&nbsp;<strong>Solo Lucci</strong>&nbsp;from July 2017 to October 2017.</p><p>Reporting by Hannah Kahn</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTqKycoKeasqy42GeaqKVfpby0wNJomqGZnpq5bsPErKtmm5%2BWwLV5wqiln6GiosBuv8eeqmackam2r7OMnaamZZaau6q%2Fzqdm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celebrity-reactions-joe-biden-kamala-harris-win.html><span>←</span><span>Celebrity Reactions to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's Election Win</span></a>
