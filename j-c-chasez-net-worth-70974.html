In 1989, his mother Karen Chasez noticed a small ad in the <i>Washington Post</i> announcing auditions for Disney's <i>The Mickey Mouse Club</i> and encouraged Chasez to try out. He chose to audition, selecting the song "Right Here Waiting" by Richard Marx. Chasez was soon cast as a performer in the fourth season and stayed until the show's cancellation in 1996. Since there was another Mouseketeer named Joshua, Chasez went by his first and last initials, "JC", to avoid confusion. It was during his time as a Mouseketeer that Chasez befriended <a href=#>Future</a> bandmate Justin Timberlake, along with other <a href=#>Future</a> entertainers including Britney Spears, Ryan Gosling, Tony Lucca, Keri Russell, and Christina Aguilera.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeaYrBur8eaqp6yXaOytXnWqKmtoF1sfXqDkw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-maria-sakkari-lesbian-what-is-her-sexuality.html><span>←</span><span>Is Maria Sakkari Lesbian What Is Her Sexuality?
