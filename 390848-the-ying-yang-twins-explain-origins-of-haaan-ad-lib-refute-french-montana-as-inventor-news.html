"Now, not saying whatever French Montana said about why they said it ain't true. It's the fact that when we got to New York, the New Yorkians said, 'fuck that shit French Montana talking about, that "Haaan" shit came from y'all.' D-Roc even went in the buildingwith <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>50 Cent</a> up there, and 50 Cent came out of that meeting and addressed D-Roc and said, 'this where that "Haaan" shit came from.'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/41/79/857941_c43255a5188b7c534adb38935524d0f4.jpg><p><h6>Jesse Grant/Getty Images</h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Kaine went on to say that they might not have known about copyright back then, but "we know the truth about what we done.
