fans’ questions&nbsp;</h2><p>Serene recently took to Instagram and invited fans to catch up with her and ask questions.&nbsp;</p><p>Naturally, many of the questions were about her and Brandon’s relationship after becoming the<a href=#> fan-favorite couple of Bachelor in Paradise.&nbsp;</a></p><p>A follower wanted to know how often the two see each other, and Serene answered, “Everyday,” which makes sense considering that <a href=#>she and Brandon moved in together </a>after getting engaged.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/serene-russell-IG-story.jpg><p>They also confirmed they live in San Diego as Serene shared a sweet photo of her and Brandon smiling at the beach with a gorgeous sunset behind them.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/serene-russell-IG-story-2.jpg><p>The couple was also asked if they had their “first argument/disagreement yet?”</p><p>Brandon and Serene were never shown arguing or having many conflicts while on Bachelor in Paradise, but they admitted they have fought since being in the real world.&nbsp;</p><p>Brandon teased that one of the things they fight about is how Serene still has stock photos in their picture frames.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/serene-russell-IG-story-3.jpg><p>The pair didn’t seem concerned about their fights, though, as they expressed fighting “like every normal couple.”&nbsp;</p><p>Fights and all, Brandon and Serene remain one of The Bachelor franchise’s favorite couples.&nbsp;</p><p>Bachelor in Paradise is currently on hiatus on ABC.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid
