He has more than 35 tattoos on his body, including those visible on his face.&nbsp;Despite his tattoo obsession, the Louisiana native advises everyone, particularly his loved ones, not to get facial tattoos. He claims that the patterns on his face are not free.</p><h2>Kevin Gates Encourages People to Get Face Tattoos</h2><p>During a Q&A session (as shown in Hip Hop Content’s film), Gates discussed his facial tattoos and claimed that he would not advocate them to anybody else. He claimed he had no problems with having designs on other areas of his body, but he advised against getting them on his face.&nbsp;The ‘Me Too’ singer expounded on the cause, claiming that having ink on the face comes with a lot of responsibilities. He emphasized that the designs would alter one’s appearance and make one seem to be a murderer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kevin-Gates-1.jpg><p>He said tattoos were socially acceptable and that his perspective was the only reason people shouldn’t have facial tattoos. Keeping his convictions, Gates said that he would not allow his daughter, Islah Koren Gates, to engage in body arts in the future. He joked that he and his wife, Dreka Gates, had marked enough drawings so she wouldn’t have to. The 35-year-old showed his fatherly affection, telling her she didn’t need to do anything since she was already lovely. Gates and Dreka had their daughter on November 30, 2012, many years before they married in October 2015.</p><h2>Gates’ face tattoos are the result of pain.</h2><p>Gates’ face is covered with tattoos, including three monochromatic teardrops and a star beneath his eyes. Furthermore, he has a unique design for a soldier’s symbol on his forehead, exactly between his brows.&nbsp;“Everything has a major significance,” the musician said in an August 2014 interview with VladTV. He even said that his facial tattoos were inspired by suffering.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kevin-Gates-2.jpg><p>Gates stressed that the writing on his forehead was not religious in nature and that it was mistaken for a conventional Christian cross. Instead, he saw a soldier’s sign — a compass indicating south, north, east, and west.&nbsp;The father-of-two also cleared the air about his teardrop designs. He said that most people felt his tattoos indicated that he was a serial murderer. He said the teardrops signified “forever in sadness,” dispelling all hypotheses. He also revealed that the star beneath his right eye was a god’s sign.</p><p>Aside from the five listed disciplines, Gates has ‘NUK’ tattooed on his left ear. He had the name Nuk The Rapper tattooed on him.&nbsp;Furthermore, the rapper’s body arts include a tree, an eagle, an elephant, a home, and many names, numbers, and letters. He also has pictures of YoungBoy Never Broke Again, Bob Marley, Luca Brasi from The Godfather, OG Boobie Black, and Elvis Presley.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Kevin Gates Face Tattoos</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiinq6Zo3qordOeqmadnpi8tr7AoJysZaCavLG4xGalqKxdqbxus8StZJ%2BZk5p6ta3Traaoq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kal-penn-wife-who-is-kal-penns-fiance-josh.html><span>←</span><span>Kal Penn Wife: Who Is Kal Penns Fianc Josh?</span></a>
