The last season of the program, which premieres today, is likely to entice Devi and his admirers.</p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Darren Barnet Wife</span></h2><p>Fans were enthralled by the chemistry between Maitreyi and Darren on-screen, which led others to theorize about a possible love relationship in real life.</p><p>It’s crucial to stress that they are only close friends and co-stars and have no romantic ties.</p><p>Although viewers of their popular series Neve Have I Ever are cheering for Devi-Paxton’s love.
