As you can see, this room was beautiful. It was fully decorated for Christmas. And now we’re not ever going to be able to have Christmas in this house ever again.”</p><p style=text-align:start>He also said that everything in his room was lost. “I had just gotten a PC back in July,” he said. “I had my Switch in there.
