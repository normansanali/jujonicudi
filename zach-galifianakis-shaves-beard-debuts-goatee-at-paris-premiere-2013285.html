He completed his clean-cut style with a three-piece gray suit, a pink shirt and maroon tie. Looking noticeable thinner on the red carpet, the comic star <a href=#>told</a> <strong>Conan O'Brien</strong> on May 15 that he recently "stopped drinking" altogether since he was "getting into much trouble" with it.&nbsp;</p><p>Galifianakis has parted ways with his scruffy beard before — during a 2010 stint on Saturday Night Live, he willingly shaved his beard into a mustache. In 2011, he also shaved his hair into a Mohawk for a sketch.</p><p>His facial hair change comes a few days after Galifianakis talked to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> about life following the Hangover movies.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I’m not sad," he told Us exclusively at the movie's Los Angeles premiere on May 20.
