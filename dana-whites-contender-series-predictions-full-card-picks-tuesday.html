amateur UFC fights have been a staple of Dana White’s Contender Series where (at least) one fighter per night earns a contract with the <a href=#>UFC</a>.</p><p>Tuesday, we have five fights on the docket and maybe some surprising picks, including one decorated kickboxer who is primed for a highlight reel showing.</p><p>The fight card is set to begin at 8 p.m. ET on ESPN+.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">UFC president Dana White talks with Laura Sanko. <span class=credit>Zuffa LLC</span></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dana White’s Contender Series</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Victor Dias vs. Kevin Borjas</h3><p>The biggest favorite on the card is Victor Dias (-375), who is primarily a grappler only.</p><p>Looking at some tape, he walks forward wildly swinging punches while standing and will have issues with strikers if he makes the UFC.</p><p>But his matchup with Kevin Borjas should be a bit easier, as Borjas trains out of Peru and is a total unknown.</p><p>Dias is a big favorite thanks to his grappling and camp pedigree at ATT – one of the best training facilities in the world.</p><p>Dias is -115 to win ITD (inside the distance) on <a href=#>Bet365</a>, and this is your only play on this fight.</p><p>Expect a submission win Tuesday evening.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Reyes Cortez could be in a rough night Tuesday. <span class=credit>Zuffa LLC</span></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Reyes Cortez vs. Payton Talbot</h3><p>Are you ready for a bantamweight matchup?</p><p>Payton Talbot is a slight favorite opposite Reyes Cortez, who we saw at the Contender Series in 2021 – a loss to Christian Rodriguez.</p><p>Cortez grappled extremely heavily in that fight, attempting 10 takedowns and only succeeding with two, but had some solid ground control.</p><p>Still, these types of fighters are not worth betting on these days because the judging criteria has flipped and damage is weight heavier than grappling control.</p><p>Talbot is going to be a much better striker, and Reyes’ toughness – which seems significant – might be the only thing that saves him from a knockout loss.</p><p>Betting Talbot moneyline (-150, <a href=#>DraftKings</a>) for this bantamweight contest.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Caio Machado vs. Kevin Szaflarski</h3><p>After opening as a pick ’em, Kevin Szaflarski has jumped to a -175 favorite opposite Caio Machado.</p><p>Machado is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu specialist with some creative striking, while Szaflarski will be looking to grapple with heavy top control.</p><p>Should this one hit the mat, Szaflarski will likely have the advantage.</p><p>He also is a massive 6-foot-6, while weighing 260.5 pounds.</p><p>Szaflarski is a rightful favorite here despite Machado’s striking advantage.</p><p>The official prediction is Machado will be a little too confident in his jiu-jitsu, go to the mat and run into massive problems.</p><p>Settle for the moneyline here on Szaflarski (-160, <a href=#>BetMGM</a>) as a decision could be in the making for this one.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Tom Nolan vs. Bogdan Grad</h3><p>There’s a massive size difference in this lightweight matchup, as Tom Nolan is 6-foot-3 while Bogdan Grad is 5-foot-9.</p><p>Nolan is fighting out of Eternal MMA and is very aggressive.</p><p>His clinch is an important piece of his game and should be a comfortable spot for him to land elbows and knees.</p><p>Grad is going to be very undersized here, but he seems to be a solid wrestler and does have solid ground and pound when on top.</p><p>Nolan’s takedown defense should be up to the test here and is worth betting at a solid -148 price on <a href=#>FanDuel</a>.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Reyes Cortez eats a clean right hand, a concern in his fight with Payton Talbot. <span class=credit>Zuffa LLC</span></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Get the lowdown on the Best USA Sports Betting Sites and Apps</h3><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Caesar Almeida vs. Lucas Fernando</h3><p>Caesar Almeida has only fought three times in MMA and faces Lucas Fernando.</p><p>Almeida is also 35-years-old but he fought in kickboxing for years and even has a win over current UFC star Alex Pereira.</p><p>The stand-up should be a brutal mismatch, but this is an MMA fight and grappling is a piece of it.</p><p>Fernando was on the Brazilian national boxing team and he can go for takedowns.</p><p>He’s a -250 favorite and rightfully so based on Almeida’s opponents having a combined record of 5-30-1.</p><p>But that power is something to behold even if the grappling doesn’t go his way in the future.</p><p>Every fight starts on the feet.</p><p><strong>Almeida by knockout in round one is +750 on <a href=#>Bet365</a>, a wild line you won’t find elsewhere.</strong></p><p>If you don’t have access to that you can take the moneyline at +220 on <a href=#>Caesars</a>.</p><p class=postsid
