Brian Kelly, who has been Notre Dame’s head football coach for the last 12 years, is expected to take over the head coaching job at LSU, according to Yahoo Sports.
The move comes just days after Lincoln Riley, who coached Oklahoma for the past five years — including three trips to the College Football Playoff and four Big 12 titles — bolted to take USC’s head coach opening."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Notre Dame could be invited to the CFP if conference title games go in its favor. Since it is not a part of a football conference, Notre Dame will not play a conference championship game.</p><p>Kelly recorded a 113-40 record in South Bend and a 5-5 record in bowl games, including a 42-14 loss to Alabama in the 2012-13 BCS Championship game and a 31-14 loss to Alabama in last January’s Rose Bowl.</p><p>Notre Dame reached the College Football Playoff twice under Kelly’s stewardship, but lost in the semifinal both times — in 2018-19 against Clemson and last season’s loss to Alabama. Kelly leaves the program as its winningest coach of all time, surpassing the legendary Knute Rockne this season.</p><p>This marks the first time Notre Dame’s head coaching position is vacant since Kelly took over in 2010. The program could reportedly be interested in promoting defensive coordinator Marcus Freeman to the role. The 35-year-old was a standout at Ohio State, but was unable to stick in the NFL. He held assistant roles at Ohio State, Kent State, Purdue and Cincinnati before taking over as defensive coordinator in South Bend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/1350331756.jpg><p>If they opt for an outsider, Iowa State’s Matt Campbell is likely a top candidate. Campbell became a hot coaching target throughout the country last year due to his work turning around the Cyclones’ program, producing a 9-3 record a season ago. His name is not as hot this year as last, in part due to his 7-5 record, but he remains one of the top candidates in the nation. He has recorded a 42-33 record in six years at Iowa State.</p><p>Cincinnati’s Luke Fickell could present an option for the Fighting Irish as well. Unlike Campbell, Fickell’s squad could potentially receive a CFP bid, complicating his possible courtship and willingness to abandon his post, a decision Kelly opted to make. The Bearcats finished the regular season 12-0 including a win over Notre Dame in South Bend, and Fickell accumulated a 47-14 record throughout five years with the program. He coached Ohio State for one season in place of Jim Tressel, who was suspended and then resigned, before joining Cincinnati.</p><p>Northwestern’s Pat Fitzgerald, Oklahoma’s interim coach Bob Stoops could emerge as options as well.</p><p>The draw for Kelly is clear — the last three LSU head coaches have won national championships. Orgeron, however, was unable to replicate the success he enjoyed in 2019, going just 11-11 the last two seasons.</p><p>When asked if he’d consider leaving Notre Dame recently, Kelly doubled down his allegiance to the Fighting Irish.</p><p>“No. I mean, look, I think Mike Tomlin had the best line, right? Unless that fairy godmother comes by with that $250 million check, my wife would want to take a look at it first,” Kelly told reporters. “I’d have to run it by her.”</p><p>It appears LSU played the role of fairy godmother.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3J7kGpma3Ffl7%2Bqrc1mop6knK56rbHAr6Cnn12jvLW%2BxGabmqWVYsGwecKomJygXaHAtnnIp2SsrKWju6q6xmakqK6VZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./angelina-jolies-daughter-vivienne-jolie-pitt-joins-mom-in-maleficent-as-princess-aurora-new-pictures-2014143.html><span>←</span><span>Angelina Jolie's Daughter Vivienne Plays Princess Aurora in Maleficent</span></a>
