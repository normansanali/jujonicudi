Three of his full siblings died in infancy, and only his half-siblings, Angela and Alois, Jr., had any documented children. Angela became a mother of three, one of whom took their own life in 1931. The other two died in 1977 and 1993. Alois, whose surname was changed from Matzelsberger to Hitler, had a son named William. Born in Liverpool in 1911, William found himself at odds with his uncle. <a href=#>Per Business Insider</a>, Hitler considered William "loathsome."</p><p>Apparently, the feeling was mutual because William moved to the U.S., joined the Navy, and fought the Nazis in WWII. In 1946, he changed his surname to Hiller. <a href=#>The Times of Israel writes</a>&nbsp;that he later changed his name a second time, becoming William Stuart-Houston. He fathered four boys: Alexander, Brian, Louis and Howard. Only Howard planned to have children, but he died in a car accident in 1989.</p><p>Alexander told the German press that one of the secret Hitlers fell in love with a Jewish woman and got engaged to her. She ultimately declined to marry him. Alexander declined to say why or which brother was involved. Meanwhile, the brothers have tried to divorce themselves from their uncle's heinous legacy. Alexander said they considered authoring a memoir but decided against it: "We won't do it, not for all the money in the world."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Bj3Fub2pfnbKzsdJmrqGZpGLBqbGMq5ylmaSew6a%2FjKidZpmUpLmneceiq6WdomKus7GMnaaippdiwbCwwLJm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./delores-sprouse-obituary.html><span>←</span><span>Heartbreaking Tragedy!
