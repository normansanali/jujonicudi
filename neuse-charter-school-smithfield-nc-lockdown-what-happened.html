On Monday, August 8th, the school proudly announced the installation of the RhinoWare® Door Lockdown System, a cutting-edge security measure designed to provide a robust defense against potential threats, especially in active shooter situations. Neuse Charter School, the only independently operated K-12 charter school in Johnston County, has consistently prioritized safety as a core element of its mission to create a positive, secure, and innovative learning environment for its students and educators.</p><p>Established in 2007, Neuse Charter School has grown to serve over 900 students, spanning from kindergarten to twelfth grade. The institution’s Superintendent, Dr. Melissa Blackwell, affirmed that safety has been a central tenet of the school’s ethos since its inception. “From the time the school was chartered in 2007, Neuse Charter School has been fully committed to providing a positive, safe, and creative learning environment,” Dr. Blackwell emphasized. The installation of the RhinoWare Door Lockdown System is a testament to Neuse Charter School’s unwavering commitment to ensuring the safety of its staff, parents, and students, and it marks a significant step forward in fulfilling this vital mission.</p><p>RhinoWare, a leading provider of advanced lockdown protection systems, has been at the forefront of safeguarding educational institutions and organizations since 2013. Their innovative security solutions have been adopted by thousands of schools nationwide, as well as corporate campuses and military installations around the world. This exceptional track record of security has made RhinoWare a trusted name in the field, with clients including the United Nations, Fort Knox, and numerous airports throughout the United States.&nbsp;The RhinoWare version 4 system, now installed at Neuse Charter School, introduces a range of advanced features designed to enhance security and safety. One of the standout elements of this technology is its single-motion activation and single-motion egress capabilities.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaKaVqsCmecKhmKuslad6tK%2FHqKalZaOitrW0xaKcpZxdo7BuuM6cop2np6N6uLTArWShmaClsq%2Bxw2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nadine-garner-net-worth-77250.html><span>←</span><span>Nadine Garner Net Worth</span></a>
