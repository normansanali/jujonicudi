And I’m grateful to my family, and I’m grateful to friends like you who were there every single day,” she told Savannah, who <a href=#>also took a brief intermission</a> from the show in March. “So, I want to say thank you for that. I love you.”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>“I feel blessed and grateful: really, really, really grateful,” Hoda gushed.</p><p>Along with Hope, whom she adopted in 2019, Hoda also has a 6-year-old daughter named Haley Joy Kotb.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Everything we know about Haley Joy Kotb and Hope Catherine Kotb — Hoda Kotb’s kids.</h2><p>Hoda<strong> </strong>defied societal standards when she adopted her eldest child at age 53.
