They played for Fresno State and quickly became fan favorites. However, in a shocking turn of events, the twins announced that they were quitting basketball to focus on their social media careers. Many were surprised by this decision, and some even criticized the twins for abandoning their <a href=#>athletic careers</a>. In this article, we'll explore the reasons behind the Cavinder twins' decision to quit basketball.</p><p>Firstly, it's important to note that the Cavinder twins didn't quit basketball because they lost their passion for the sport. In fact, they both loved playing basketball and had dreams of playing in the WNBA. However, as their social media following grew, they began to see new opportunities outside of <a href=#>basketball</a>. They saw the potential to turn their <a href=#>social media presence</a> into a business and make a living off of it.</p><p>The twins had already amassed a large following on TikTok, where they shared videos of their basketball skills and daily lives. Their videos were entertaining, and fans loved seeing the twins' personalities shine through. As their following grew, the twins began to receive sponsorship offers and requests for collaborations. They saw the potential to make a lot of money through social media and decided to pursue that route.</p><p>Another factor in their decision was the time commitment required for basketball. Playing basketball at the <a href=#>collegiate level </a>is a full-time job. The twins had to balance their classes, practices, games, and travel schedule. On top of that, they were also trying to grow their social media presence. It became too much to handle, and they felt like they were spreading themselves too thin. By quitting basketball, they could focus all of their time and energy on their social media careers.</p><p>It's also worth noting that the COVID-19 pandemic played a role in their decision. The pandemic disrupted the 2020-2021 basketball season, and the twins' schedule was constantly changing. They didn't know when games would be canceled or when they would have to quarantine. This made it difficult for them to plan their social media content and fulfill their sponsorship obligations. By quitting basketball, they could have more control over their schedules and avoid any potential conflicts with their social media commitments.</p><p>Some critics have accused the twins of abandoning their<a href=#> athletic careers </a>and setting a bad example for young athletes. However, it's important to remember that the Cavinder twins are adults who are capable of making their own decisions. They aren't obligated to pursue basketball just because they're good at it. They have the right to pursue other opportunities and passions.</p><p>Moreover, the twins have stated that they're not closing the door on basketball entirely. They still love the sport and may consider playing professionally in the future. They just didn't want to continue playing at the collegiate level while also trying to build their social media careers.</p><p>In conclusion, the Cavinder twins quit basketball to pursue their social media careers and take advantage of new opportunities. They didn't make the decision lightly and still have a passion for the sport. While some may disagree with their decision, it's important to respect their autonomy and support them in their new endeavors. The twins are still young and have a bright future ahead of them, whether it's in basketball, social media, or something else entirely.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn7JllJ6xbsDHnmScmaaeu6Wx0WarsKGeqHqywcitZJuZo6Cyta7ApaM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./archive-81-viewers-saying-same-thing-netflix-horror-show.html><span>←</span><span>Viewers are saying the same thing about Netflix's Archive 81</span></a>
