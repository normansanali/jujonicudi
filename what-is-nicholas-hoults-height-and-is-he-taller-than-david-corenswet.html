Nicholas Hoult is 6 feet 3 inches tall (191 cm for all of us on the other side of the Atlantic) and even as tall as he is, he can’t quite reach the stature of his on-screen rival-to-be.</p><p data-characters=482 data-current-count=807 data-injectable=true>That’s right, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DC’s new gorgeous Superman actor</a> is an impressive 6 feet 4 inches tall (193 cm). A difference of one inch that, while probably irrelevant for Hoult, probably makes Lex a little mad with envy. The vicious CEO of LexCorp is just the type of guy to have a height complex when it comes to his archnemesis, and resent the one inch separating the two. Who knows, maybe James Gunn will make platform shoes a defining character visual of his version of Lex Luthor?</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What is Superman: Legacy about?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/David-Corenswet-Clark-Kent-Superman.jpg><p data-characters=576 data-current-count=876 data-injectable=false>Following the strikes that led Hollywood to a standstill over the summer of 2023, James Gunn has reassured fans Superman: Legacy will still be meeting its July 2025 release date. It’s early days for the origin story film, which is expected to begin production in early 2024, but so far we do know this new iteration of the Man of Steel will go back to the character’s classic image as “the embodiment of truth, justice and the American way,” and will see the Kryptonian superhero struggle to reconcile his human upbringing with his outer-world origins.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGZpGK2tHnNopqhp5yWwG60zq6jratdnbKqs8etZJqmlGK2tHnHnmStmZyhsrN506GYp2WUlsOqsIycpqudnqjEpsCO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vonn-bell-contract-salary-and-net-worth-explored.html><span>←</span><span>Vonn Bell contract, salary and net worth explored</span></a>
