The four angles show just how intricate and bling-tastic the 3-carat oval stunner is. The ring features five rows of pave diamonds along the band and diamonds under the bezel of the four-prong setting.</p><p>Not only did the Whitney Eve clothing designer share the sketches, she also shared the story of how her producer beau proposed to her—not once, but twice!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“To make a very long story short, Timmy originally planned to propose to me in Australia but the plan didn’t go quite his way…,” the City alum began her post, explaining that before she and her husband-to-be were set to jet Down Under for a vacation, she overheard Rosenman’s boss wishing him “good luck” at the end of a phone conversation. When she couldn’t stop asking him what his boss meant, Rosenman dropped down on one knee and proposed to the reality star then and there.</p><p>But he hadn’t purchased Port’s ring yet, which gave her a little time to tell him exactly what she’d like. “I told him I loved oval shape and rose gold. He met with [Bensimon], who went above and beyond and found the most beautiful stone ever in Israel. It was flown across the world to him, where he set it and then delivered it to our hotel in Sydney!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>That’s when Rosenman proposed to Port for the second time. Lucky lady!</p><p>What do you think of Port’s ring and double proposal story?
