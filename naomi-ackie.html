One after another, she worked on various projects, including “Cleaning Up,” “Vera,” “The Corrupted,” and “Love, Sex and Side Effects.”</p><p>Her extraordinary performance in “Star Wars: Episode IX – The Rise of Skywalker” helped her land the lead role in “Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody,” which got released in 2022.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Naomi Ackie height and weight" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Naomi-Ackie-height-and-weight.jpg alt="Naomi Ackie height and weight" width=400 height=384 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Naomi Ackie’s Love Life</strong></h2><p>Ackie is secretive.
