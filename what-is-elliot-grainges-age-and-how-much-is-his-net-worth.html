He was born on 06 November 1993 in England, United Kingdom. He is, therefore, British and not American, as some would erroneously assume. Unfortunately, his mother, attorney Samantha Berg, suffered an amniotic fluid embolism while birthing him. She slipped into a coma as a result and never recovered, finally passing away in 2007.</p><p>Elliot Grange’s father, on the other hand, is Sir Lucian Charles Grainge. He is the chairman and CEO of Universal Music Group, one of the biggest record labels in America. He is in his second marriage with Elliot’s stepmother, Caroline Grainge. Elliot has two step-sisters, Alice Grainge and Betsy Grainge, from his father’s second marriage.</p><h3><strong>Elliot Grainge’s Birthday Dates</strong></h3><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Year</strong></td><td><strong>Birthdate</strong></td><td><strong>Day</strong></td></tr><tr><td>2024</td><td>6 November</td><td>Wednesday</td></tr><tr><td>2025</td><td>6 November</td><td>Thursday</td></tr><tr><td>2026</td><td>6 November</td><td>Friday</td></tr><tr><td>2027</td><td>6 November</td><td>Saturday</td></tr><tr><td>2028</td><td>6 November</td><td>Monday</td></tr><tr><td>2029</td><td>6 November</td><td>Tuesday</td></tr><tr><td>2030</td><td>6 November</td><td>Wednesday</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><strong>He Moved to the United States in 2009 for College</strong></h3><p>Elliot spent his childhood and teenage years in the U.K. He attended a local private school in the United Kingdom before moving to the United States in 2009.

The whole family settled in Los Angeles, while Elliot enrolled in Northeastern University in Boston.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/american-british-musician-elliot-grainge.png alt width=770 height=455 sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>As a student, Elliot started his first business venture with a fellow student partner. After graduating with a bachelor’s degree, he moved back to Los Angeles and launched his record label 10K Project. The label is focused more on artistic integrity than commercial success. The now 30-year-old music executive has successfully made a name for himself away from his father’s shadows.</p><h2><strong>What is Elliot Grainge’s Net Worth as of 2023?</strong></h2><p>Elliot Grainge’s net worth in 2023 is estimated at $10 million.

In 2022, Elliot Grainge and his fiancée purchased a $26.9 million mansion in Brentwood, Los Angeles, California, that once belonged to UTA’s CEO Jeremy Zimmer. This purchase shows Elliot Grainge’s financial prowess.</p><table><tbody readability=1><tr><td><strong>Assets and Properties</strong></td><td><strong>Value</strong></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>10K Projects Record Label</td><td>$7 million</td></tr><tr><td>Brentwood Mansion</td><td>$25 million</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><strong>Elliot Grainge’s also Earns from Successful Business Ventures</strong></h3><p>While in school Grainge partnered with Boston University student Robbie Earl to create and run their company ‘<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Take Boston</a>’. ‘Take Boston’ was all about providing a unique nightlife experience for partygoers in Boston.

But from what we have seen so far, it appears Elliot Grainge worked hard for his money. He no doubt inherited the entrepreneurial spirit from his dad. Right from University, he was already running his business. It is therefore not surprising that he would hit the ground running once he kicked off his music label venture.</p><p>10K Projects was founded in 2016 and has been quite successful thus far. However, Elliot also had some help with the Virgin Music Label & Artist Services, a division of Universal Music Group that helped with the distribution aspect of the label. Elliot Grainge has access to the wealth of knowledge and connection his father has amassed in his years in the industry. However, the bulk of the work rested on his shoulders as an indie music executive.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/elliot-grainge-and-chairman-ceo-of-universal-music-group-news-photo-1617805641.jpeg alt="What Is Elliot Grainge’s Age and How Much is His Net Worth?" width=768 height=597 sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><h2><strong>Who is Elliot Grainge’s Dad, Sir Lucian Charles Grainge</strong></h2><p>Lucian Charles Grainge has worked in the entertainment industry his entire career.
