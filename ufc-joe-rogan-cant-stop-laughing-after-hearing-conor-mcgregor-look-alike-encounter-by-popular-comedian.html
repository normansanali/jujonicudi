Gillis shared a hilarious story about his time in Dublin. The story was about the comedian’s interaction with a <strong>Conor McGregor</strong> look-alike.</p><p>Joe Rogan couldn’t hold his laugh when Gillis explained the appearance of the guy who showed up. Gillis said, “We are at this bar. We are drinking after the show. This f*cking Irish kid shows up. He is Conor McGregor.” The person wore skin-tight jeans and was shadowboxing boxing, which increased the McGregor comparison. Apparently, Gillis had to restrain the man for almost 20 minutes to stop him from fighting his friend, <strong>Brady Quinn</strong>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Rogan, like <strong>Dana White,</strong> has a cordial relationship with Conor McGregor. Joe Rogan witnessed McGregor’s ascension to the top in real-time. He interviewed McGregor after the featherweight and lightweight title wins. Rogan and McGregor share the octagon once again when the Irishman returns to the octagon. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joe Rogan</a> has supported McGregor despite the controversies of the Irishman in recent times.</p><p>The Irishman broke his leg in his last fight against <strong>Dustin Poirier.</strong> He has not fought since 2021 and could come back in a fight against <strong>Michael Chandler</strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> in late 2023 or early 2024.</a> He called out <strong>Justin Gaethje</strong> for the BMF belt, but the chances of that fight happening are negligent.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Only reason I’m knocking him out,” Israel Adesanya reveals details on TikTok dance with painted nails after finishing Sean Strickland</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Q_1693900525.jpg><p>Along with <strong>Jon Anik</strong> and <strong>Daniel Cormier</strong>, Joe Rogan occupies the premier spots in the commentating ranks of the UFC. With Rogan’s popularity ever-growing, his presence in the UFC commentary booth has been shrunk to pay-per-view events in the USA.</p><p><strong>Laura Sanko</strong> is set to make her pay-per-view commentary debut at UFC 293. At UFC 293, Sanko would become the first woman since <strong>Kathy Long </strong>to commentate a pay-per-view event in the UFC. She had done commentary work in the Dana White Contender Series. Sanko had made her debut in UFC commentary in a fight night event headlined by <strong>Sergey Spivak</strong> and <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Derrick Lewis</a>.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Sanko has competed in MMA just once. It was with the Invicta Fighting Championships in 2013. She won the fight via submission. Recently, Laura Sanko has been trolled for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her appreciation of the Kazhaksthani welterweight</a> contender, <strong>Shavkat Rakhmonov</strong>. Daniel Cormier and Laura Sanko have a Tom and Jerry relationship, as evidenced by their interaction in the pre-fight show by ESPN hosted by Dan Hellie.</p><p><strong>In case you missed it!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK571J%2BaZqKfmnqzu8aapWabkaPBbr%2FTqKdmpJGqtKm1zaBkmp6kmr9utMSaqaKml2KwsLrOq2Smm5ensqi70WajqKebYq6ttcqeZJ6mk6TCr8DEq2SbsV2lvLHBy5qpZpuforKltcCnZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./there-has-to-be-a-reason-im-chasing-ethan-mission-impossible-7-star-demanded-a-worthwhile-backstory.html><span>←</span><span>There has to be a reason Im chasing Ethan: Mission: Impossible 7 star demanded a wort</span></a>
