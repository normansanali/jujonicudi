I was like, 'No, I don't want to! I don't want to.'"</p><p>In 2017, Jennifer shared with&nbsp;<a href=#>Smashing Interviews Magazine</a>&nbsp;what Michael was like off-set when he was at home with his family. "He was incredibly fun and very funny," Jennifer said of her father, adding that she "had a lot of respect for him." <a href=#>The "Yellowstone" cast member</a>&nbsp;has said that Michael had a harmonious relationship with his kids, which set the tone for a pleasant home life. "It makes for a very calm household, I think, when parents have very clear roles with their kids about what is expected and what's not and then everything just goes smoothly," she explained. While her father may have died while she was young, Jennifer has recalled a few happy memories she shared with him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhmaH16fI6ynKWkn6zAtbvNnqpmopWju6qyxKtkpZmembyveceaqmaZXZuurrvUrGSfmaSdsrN7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-did-the-cavinder-twins-quit-basketball.html><span>←</span><span>Why did the Cavinder twins quit basketball?</span></a>
