And when you have bosses telling you that you’re the only person who gets a person to work on time, and 200 people either get to see their kids at night or they don’t because our days start on time.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Sarah-Roemer-Chad-Michael-Murray-Sophia-Bush.jpg><p>Murray’s rep <a href=#>responded to Bush’s allegations</a> in a statement released to&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;on Thursday: “This story is ludicrous. Chad conducts himself in a completely professional manner and would never marry for any reason but love. Thirteen years since his divorce from Sophia, he has a very happy family life with his wife and children. He has completely moved on and doesn’t feel the need to engage in this type of behavior.”</p><p>The&nbsp;Cinderella Story&nbsp;actor, 36, spoke for himself when he <a href=#>seemingly shaded his ex-wife</a> on Twitter. “Do u know what I do every morning?” he asked on Thursday. “Wake in my loving family’s embrace, make coffee & breakfast 4 the kiddos with my wife. Read 1-2 chapters in the Bible 2 start the day off right. Then we plan how 2 fill the day with love 4 my family & brethren. It’s so simple yet so fulfilling.” Murray also tweeted a GIF of Pinocchio’s nose growing and noted his love of cartoons in an apparent dig at Bush, who stars in&nbsp;Incredibles 2.</p><p>The&nbsp;John Tucker Must Die&nbsp;star clarified her comments about her marriage to Murray on Twitter late&nbsp;Wednesday: “Don’t twist people’s words, y’all. If it wasn’t clear, I was making fun of MYSELF. And if all the years that have passed haven’t made it WILDLY clear that we’re all grown ups who’ve become the best versions of ourselves, then I just don’t know what to say. And PS, if my teasing MYSELF on the radio today — for my past — hurt anyone’s feelings, I am sorry.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Murray and Bush wed in April 2005 while starring on&nbsp;One Tree Hill. They separated&nbsp;five months later, and their divorce was finalized in December 2006.</p><p>The actor married Roemer, with whom he shares <a href=#>two kids</a>, in January 2015.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasmaKWtW6%2Bzp6knqpdpbyssdJmna6mXZbBbr%2FOqZ%2BimV2XwrS00makmqqinq6osYycpqallaPBtHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./osbourne-family-album-2012510.html><span>←</span><span>Ozzy and Sharon Osbournes Family Album With Kelly and Jack</span></a>
