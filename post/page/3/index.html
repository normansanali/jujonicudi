<a href=../../../bmw-ix-vs-tesla-model-y.html></a>

I know what you’re thinking — the BMW iX is way more expensive than the Tesla Model Y.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Meaning Behind The Song: Una banda y un corrido by Los Rehenes</h2><time>Oct 1, 2024</time>

Perfect by nature,
Icons of self indulgence,
Just what we all need,
More lies about a world that...Never was and never will be
Have you no shame?
Don't you see me?
You know you've got everybody fooled
Look, here she comes now
Bow down and stare in wonder,
Oh how we love you,
No flaws when you're pretending
But now I know she...
Never was and never will be
You don't know how you've betrayed me,</article><article class=post-entry><h2>AGENCY &amp;amp; MANAGEMENT NEWS: John Mayer Signs With WMA &amp;amp; Mark Dinerstein Joins Entourage Talent Associa</h2><time>Sep 30, 2024</time>
