In fact, both Goth and Emo originally (and presently) referred to specific music genres with punk roots before they were considered personal styles.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who Are Pedro Pascal's Siblings?

Oddly enough, Jimmy Fallon and I — a young Asian woman from the opposite coast — share a random commonality: a love for Gilmore Girls’ Jess Mariano. The late night TV host proclaimed his Team Jess allegiance when he interviewed Alexis Bledel on The Tonight Show in 2016. Whereas Fallon admitted he had gotten into the series later than most (he asked Bledel to remain mum about spoilers nine years after the show ended, after all), I, on the other hand, have been a longtime devotee of the mother-daughter dramedy — and, in extension, a devotee of Rory (Bledel) and Jess’s (Milo Ventimiglia) onscreen romance that seeped into real life.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/15/>← Prev Page</a>
