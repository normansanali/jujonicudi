As he recalled to <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> in 1997, she asked him "Are you exploiting my sister's death by living in her house?"

Besides, the album was done, and he had to go on a yearlong promotional tour. However, Reznor still stole the front door to the house, according to <a href=#>All That's Interesting</a>, dragging it with him to his next studio in New Orleans, where it has since been preserved.</p><p>Today, that door is all that's left of 10050 Cielo Drive. In April 1994, a few months after Reznor's departure, the owners demolished the house, changing it entirely, and re-branding it with a new address.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BkW9ub2lfqbWmedOrrK2gXZavsMHTZqurnZ6perOx2aemq6tdqbausYyipWasmJp6rq3NrKanZZ2qv6Wx0WafqK2jmnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-pokemon-teams-for-the-master-league-in-pokemon-go.html><span>←</span><span>The best Pokmon teams for the Master League in Pokmon Go - January 2023</span></a>
