After winning his season, Bryce has shared plans to move to Nashville to continue his music career, but right now he is focusing on earning the money for it.

He is taking steps to advance his music career now that he has gained some well-deserved notoriety on 'The Voice'. He is first working to save enough funds so that he may move to Nashville.</p><p>Even though Leatherwood won Season 22, he is still a student in his early 20s who is only beginning to see the prospects of his career. Bryce told Music Mayhem, “I’m still a broke college kid. I don’t care what prize money they threw my way. I’m not even going to see that. That’s going to go in into some investments. So I just gotta stay young, stay broke, and stay hungry because thriving off a little, you can grow a lot more than thriving off a lot. So, I’m just very excited to pursue my career.”</p><p>Bryce also has a lifelong ambition that he is looking forward to achieving. He revealed that one day, he hopes to be invited to play at the Grand Ole Opry. “Well, ever since I picked up a guitar, that’s been a dream of mine. So if I get that opportunity one day, that’ll be a dream come true," he shared in an interview.</p><h2 class=split>Bryce Leatherwood's stint on 'The Voice' Season 22</h2><p>Bryce proved he had what it required to succeed as 'The Voice's next champion during the blind auditions, battles, and knockouts. With each advancement in the competition, Bryce displayed an exceptional vocal range and delivered performances that were both sincere and moving. During 'The Voice' battle rounds, Bryce and The Dryes faced off and chose to perform Brooks & Dunn's 'Red Dirt Road'. Although The Dryes also sounded beautiful, Leatherwood won the competition because of his seamless ability to create fantastic stories with just his voice.</p><p>The intensity is often turned up during 'The Voice' Knockouts, but Bryce nailed it with his rendition of 'Colder Weather' by the Zac Brown Band. For the opening night of 'The Voice' Live Finals, Leatherwood used some elaborate lighting effects, which gave his rendition of Keith Whitley's 'Don't Shut Your Eyes' a dark and personal touch. As they teamed together for a performance of 'Hillbilly Bone', a song by Shelton himself, during the Live Finale, Coach Shelton and Bryce gave the viewers the country concert of their dreams.</p><p>'The Voice' Season 23 premieres on March 6.
