So <strong>he is theatrical, interesting, totally like a little girl</strong>, and it's so funny because he and Buddy&nbsp;get on really well but Buddy is a real boy and he is like a little girl, but a boy so I don't know. I have no idea. I just hope they have Frozen dresses in the dress up box, in an all-boys school. He is just a character."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/10e3328b507c-river-rocket-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eGUQiv1sz7ZN data-wc=6><strong>River will turn four in August</strong></p><p id=eMPLZElbS9Bo data-wc=57>Sharing her nerves with the both Zoe and Georgia, she continued: "He is quite OK to leave me, and he is good with other people so we'll just see.

Most recently, <a class=hm-link href=#>Jools shared an adorable picture of her nearly four-year-old wearing a pair of fairy wing</a>s adorned with a gold fabric bow whilst riding his scooter. Jools captioned the photo simply with a monkey emoji, and it wasn't long before her followers commented on the youngster's adorable appearance. "Heartbreaker," one commented. "That's just too much," another wrote, while Joe Wicks commented with a string of smiley face and heart emojis.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
