On Friday, the singer played a show at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Australia to a sold-out venue with a whopping 96,000 fans in the audience — making it her biggest show ever.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This is the biggest show that we have done on this tour or any tour I have ever done," Swift told a cheering crowd in a video shared to X (formerly Twitter). "That's the version you get of me tonight, the version that's completely starstruck by the fact that so many of you wanted to hang out with us on a Friday night in Melbourne."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Swift also has two more shows in Melbourne on Feb. 17 and 18 before she heads to Sydney for her shows at Accor Stadium. In the last week, Swift has practically made it the entire way around the world. Swift performed in Tokyo last weekend before jetting off to see her boyfriend play in the Super Bowl on Sunday night. After the Kansas City Chiefs clinched the storied Vince Lombardi trophy, Swift and Kelce celebrated by partying until the wee early hours in Las Vegas alongside his team, fellow celebs, and her friends and family.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unfortunately, earlier this week, a mass shooting killed one and injured 23 people during the Kansas City Chiefs victory parade. This morning, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Swift donated $100,000</a> to a GoFundMe page created for the deceased's family. “Sending my deepest sympathies and condolences in the wake of your devastating loss. With love, Taylor Swift,” she wrote alongside her contribution.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK5705qwpaeiYsC4tcWtZKyskafAtb7UnKJmpZWhr7DB0aecZquYpMRursignp6rpGKyt7HRZm9ucGRngng%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./singer-jewel-predicted-the-death-of-zappos-ceo-tony-hsieh.html><span>←</span><span>Singer Jewel predicted the death of Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh</span></a>
