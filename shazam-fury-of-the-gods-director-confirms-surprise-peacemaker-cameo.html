The majority of movies have taken place in the exact same universe and timeline as the one that kicked off a decade ago through Zack Snyder‚Äôs Man of Steel, with the upcoming Black Adam, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shazam! Fury of the Gods</a></strong>, and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom proof of that.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=398 data-current-count=398 data-injectable=false>The former features <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Viola Davis reprising her role as Amanda Waller</a>, the latter has Ben Affleck back for a Bruce Wayne cameo, while director David F. Sandberg‚Äôs sequel opened its brand new San Diego Comic-Con trailer with footage of the canonical Justice League. Place it under a little scrutiny, and not much has changed outside of Snyder‚Äôs departure and subsequent abandoned projects.</p><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=736 data-injectable=true>James Gunn‚Äôs Peacemaker is also official canon <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">as confirmed by the filmmaker himself</a>, so even though Sandberg wouldn‚Äôt confirm or deny the identity of the character being played by Rizwan Manji that was spotted in the Fury of the Gods promo, we‚Äôd feel safe in saying Jamil the Janitor is making a surprise DCEU comeback.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Yes that's Rizwan. Peter Safran recommended him for a part after working with him on Peacemaker. I said "but that's the same universe". He said "he's barely in Peacemaker".

Fury of the Gods, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, and The Flash together to name but four. Jamil stole his scene opposite John Cena in Peacemaker, so we‚Äôre sure he‚Äôll be a worthy addition no matter how big or small his contributions end up being.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqqGZqpa6brLUq7Bmp5ZiwamxjKCmnatdmbazscKtpqtlk6S7p7XRpqpmq6WnvbO10p5kqZ2RmLKurcqeqWabkaKysHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sd-association-uhs-iii-a2-class-lv-signaling.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>SD Association Announces UHS-III (up to 624 MB/s), A2 Class, LV Signaling</span></a>
