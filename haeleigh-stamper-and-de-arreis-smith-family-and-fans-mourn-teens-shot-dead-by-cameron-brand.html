Both Stamper and Smith were students at Hancock High School.</p><p>Brand, 19, of Pass Christian, was arrested after he opened fire as 60 to 70 students from Bay High School in Bay St Louis and Hancock High School in Kiln were celebrating on Sunday, April 30.

"He was loved by many and will be missed so very much by his family," she told the&nbsp;.</p><p>Smith's grandmother Jackie Gordon said that the teen left his house Saturday night, April 29, with friends who were attending the party. “He was a good kid, and for this to happen, I have no words for that,” said Gordon, according to . She received a call about the shooting the next morning from the hospital.&nbsp;</p><p>“About 1:30 in the morning, that’s when I got the call that he had gotten shot,” she said. “When they said he got shot, I asked how he got shot, what happened.” When she arrived at the hospital, a teen told her he saw Smith getting shot. Smith was shot in the back of the head and was rushed to a New Orleans hospital.&nbsp;</p><p>“He could not talk — he was unresponsive. His head was wrapped up, he had tubes all in him, but he couldn’t talk. He did not know I was there," Gordon said. Smith was pronounced dead at 7 am. “It was terrible. I did not want to leave him. That’s the hardest part, leaving him at the hospital," Gordon said.&nbsp;</p><p>She added, "I don’t want it to be swept under the rug. I don’t want to say I don’t want justice for De’arreis, but I want accountability, because justice would be him being here with me.”</p><p>A has been sent up to raise funeral expenses for the teen. "On April 30, 2023, 18yr old De'Arreis Smith, affectionately known as "DD'', lost his life due to a senseless act of gun violence. De'Arreis and five young people were the victims of what could be defined as a mass shooting at an after-prom party in Bay St. Louis, MS. De'Arreis had many plans for his life and was just getting started preparing for life after high school," the page read.</p><p>The page says Smith lost his dad to "yet another attack on the lives of Black males" in the past. "We could not have imagined losing De'Arreis in such a violent, senseless, horrific manner. Just nearly two years ago, De'Arreis lost his father to yet another attack on the lives of black males. Although he struggled with the loss of his father, he tried to be strong for the sake of his mother, grandmothers and siblings. De'Arreis was the life of any party. He was so charismatic and loved making people laugh, a natural trait that he inherited from his father. De'Arreis was really a special young man and will be sorely missed. Please donate to help us lay "DD" to rest. He is with his father now. May they both rest in Power!"

She was the light in everybody’s life. You couldn’t have a bad day when she was around,” she said.</p><p>“Everybody said that she was the light in everyone’s life and she had a pure soul,” Jones said, adding, “And she has so much going for her. She was not meant to die. All she wanted was to have fun in life. That was her main goal in life: she wanted to have fun.”</p><p>Many who knew Stamper remembered her on social media. "I dont even know what to say. i just can’t believe this is real. you were one of the most loving people ive ever met. i cant believe i’ll never have the chance to even see you in the hallway anymore. even if we werent talking at the time you would always make a point to smile at me and tell me hey. it always made my day. i am going to miss that forever. i love you so much Haeleigh Stamper. rest in peace beautiful girl," her friend Kalynn Kopszywa wrote on Facebook.</p><p>"You were loved by more people than you know Haeleigh. Ill never forget the sneaking out of your window. Or trading shifts with people just to work with you. Or when you would sneak me a blizzard in a drink cup. Your laugh was so contagious. You were so caring to everyone no matter what the situation was. This isnt goodbye forever. I know ill see you in heaven angel. I love you forever and always," another friend Arieal Whitaker wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>Tina Fontenot Wolfe, a teacher, wrote, "No matter the years that pass, all of the students that I have taught are always apart of my heart. My first year teaching I taught the best group of kids. Among them was a beautiful, petit girl that had an incredibly contagious smile, Haeleigh Stamper. She was always a great friend to the other students and had so much ambition. I am mortified that all of that was taken away- I’m praying for everyone hurting by this unimaginable tragedy."</p><p>A has been set up for Stamper. "Hi, my name is Lillie, I started this go fund me to help with the expenses of services for the family of Haeleigh Stamper. She passed away after suffering 3 gunshots wounds while attending an after prom event. Haeleigh was such a sweet soul. you could never not smile around her.
