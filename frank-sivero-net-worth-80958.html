The lawsuit alleges that in 1989 Sivero was living next door to <a href=#>Writers</a> from <i>The Simpsons</i> and the <a href=#>Writers</a> knew he was working on his <i>Goodfellas</i> character. It alleges the <a href=#>Writers</a> "were aware the entire character of 'Frankie Carbone' was created and developed by Sivero, who based this character on his own personality." A short time later, a character named Louie began appearing on <i>The Simpsons</i>. Louie has been described as a mafioso character, second in command to Fat Tony, and similar in appearance and mannerisms to Sivero, and his "likeness is being infringed in violation of California's publicity rights law." The case was dismissed in August 2015, with the judge asserting it was a parody of several Mob characters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeWp66vt4ysoK%2BdoqR6r7HTZq6oqqSdenl8mG5v</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./espurr-02-38.html><span>←</span><span>Espurr (02-38) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</span></a>
