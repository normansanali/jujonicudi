The pair, who began their romance in 2004, were introduced through Bertinelli’s brother Patrick. Six years later, Vitale popped the question while vacationing with Bertinelli in Florence, Italy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Valerie-Bertinelli-Reveals-Shes-Dating-Special-Man-After-2022-Divorce-Inline.jpg><p>“If the time wasn’t right, I wouldn’t have asked,” Vitale told AARP after news broke of their engagement. “We’re both still a little afraid of commitment, but then we were over there, and it was like our souls were calibrated.”</p><p>Bertinelli added, “We’d talked about getting married, but I was still shocked. It was sweet when he asked me, because he was so scared. I was like, ‘Are you kidding me?’”</p><p>Following their split, Bertinelli has been <a href=#>candid about her healing process</a> via social media, sharing an Instagram video in February 2023 about the benefits of rolfing, an alternative medicine that involves soft tissue massage.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I believe that a lot of emotional pain is stored in the body, and I’m doing my best to heal from it in every way — my therapy, my journaling, my meditation, rolfing,” she explained.</p><p>She also playfully took to TikTok to share a video of herself alongside the caption, “When someone asks if I’ll start dating again…” In the clip, she laughed and mouthed, “F–k no.”</p><p>Bertinelli amended that statement on Monday, March 11, <a href=# rel=noopener>reposting that clip on X</a> and offering a winking nod to her new relationship. “This didn’t age well 🤪🥰,” Bertinelli quipped.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGavmZyav6qxjJucq6yZo7KtuMhmqZ6ulZa5tHnSoZysZZSWwaq6xmaYn6yVp3q1u8xmraKskaGybrDIr6arm5Vk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-curse-of-oak-island-season-9-release-date-cast-and-more-information.html><span>←</span><span>The Curse Of Oak Island Season 9</span></a>
