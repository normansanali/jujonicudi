Natalia Dyers Hometown</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Netizens are curious to know if Nancy Wheeler is still in high school or not after the fourth season of the Netflix series aired on the 27th of May 2022.</strong></p><p>Nancy is one of the broadly recognized characters of the eminent Netflix series Stranger Things. Actress Natalia Dyer portrays the character.</p><p>The prominent character is the sister of Mike Wheeler, one of the main cast of the series, and the ex-girlfriend of Steve Harrington, a fictional character played by Joe Keery.</p><p>Wheeler starts investigating Will Byers when her friend Barbara Holland also goes missing. She teamed up with her future boyfriend Jonathan to investigate them, which is when they found Upside Down.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-stranger-things-nancy-wheeler-still-in-high-school></span>Is Stranger Things Nancy Wheeler Still In High School?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, Nancy Wheeler isn’t still in high school.</p><p>In fact, she was working at the Hawkins Post, a newspaper printing media for issuing an independent newspaper of Hawkins, with her boyfriend Jonathon.</p><p>The series is mostly set in&nbsp;1986, and the character Nancy was born in 1967 hence, in the first season, she was 15 or 16 years. As of this season, the character is 18 years already.</p><p>She is Ted and Karen Wheeler’s eldest child and elder sister of her younger brother Mike and younger sister Holly. In the spring of 1986, she works as an editor at the Hawkins Post.</p><p>When Nancy strove to work hard and do her best from the very first day, she started working at the Hawkins. Yet, surrounded by misogynistic co-workers, she was belittled and mocked by them.</p><p>She was determined to receive the approval and recognition from her misogynistic co-workers by going to lengths to be treated respectfully as well as equally by them.</p><p>Working late one night at the paper, Wheeler answers a call about diseased rats. She secretly investigates it with Jonathan which leads them to be fired and creates a rift in their relationship.</p><p>However, after getting some encouragement from her mother, she picks the story back up. Later she discovers that the rats and Mrs. Driscoll’s strange habits are linked to the Mind Flayer that possessed Will.</p><p>Eventually, the prominent character reconciles with her boyfriend, Jonathan.

She is known to have a tremendous amount of resolve, bravery, and conviction.</p><p>Let alone her strong academic history, and she also appears to possess a natural detective character. In the concrete, Wheeler is one of the most notable and robust characters in the series.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=nancy-wheeler-hometown-and-family></span>Nancy Wheeler Hometown And Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Talking about Nancy Wheeler’s hometown and family, she is from Hawkins, Indiana, United States. The American character reportedly studied at Hawkins High School.</p><p>Wheeler has a family of five, with three children. Her family comprises her parents, Karen Wheeler and Ted Wheeler, and her two younger siblings, Mike Wheeler and Holly Wheeler.</p><p>Nancy’s relationship with her brother Mike appeared to have improved immensely after all they have been through for the past two years. They drifted apart as they grew up, most likely due to the age gap.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKGjYsC1vsCnnp6qXam1qrrGrGSnmZ6Yxm7Dx56cpZ2iYsC1tculZKKmXZ22qLSMrJqhp5%2Bheq%2Bt05qjopldmcamvtJmn6illam8uLqMa2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./iliza-shlesinger.html><span>←</span><span>Iliza Shlesinger</span></a>
